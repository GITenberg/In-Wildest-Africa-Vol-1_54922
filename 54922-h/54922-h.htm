Preface</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I&nbsp;never</span> dreamed that my book <i>With Flashlight
and Rifle</i>&mdash;alike in its German and its English and
American editions&mdash;would receive everywhere so kind a
welcome, or that it would make for me so many new
friends, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>I have been encouraged by this success to give a fresh
series of my studies of African wild life and of my “Nature
Documents,” as Dr. Ludwig Heck has designated my
photographs, in the present work.</p>

<p>I should like to express my gratitude once again to
all those who, in one way or another, have furthered my
labours in connection with these two books, especially to
Dr. Heck himself and the other men of eminence and
learning whose names I mentioned in my preface to <i>With
Flashlight and Rifle</i>. A complete list of all my kind
helpers and well-wishers would be too long to print here.
I am deeply indebted, too, to the many correspondents&mdash;men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
of note and young schoolboys alike&mdash;who have
written to me to express their appreciation of my achievements.
Their praises have gone to my heart. I owe
a special word of thanks to President Roosevelt, who
smoothed the way for my book in the United States by
his reference to me in his own volume <i>Outdoor Pastimes
of an American Hunter</i>. I take the more pleasure in
discharging this debt in that I had long derived intense
enjoyment from President Roosevelt’s masterly descriptions
of wild life and sport in America. President Roosevelt
has always been one of the foremost pioneers in the
movement for the preservation of nature in all its forms,
and has made every possible use of the resources placed
at his disposal by his high position to further this end.</p>

<p>This new book of mine is in form a series of impressions
and sketches, loosely strung together; but it will
serve, I hope, indirectly to win over my readers to the
one underlying idea&mdash;the idea upon which I harp so often&mdash;of
the importance of taking active steps to prevent the
complete extermination of wild life.</p>

<p>Like <i>With Flashlight and Rifle</i>, this supplementary
work can claim to stand out from the ranks of all other
volumes of the kind as regards the character of its illustrations.
All those photographs which I have taken myself
are reproduced from the original negatives without retouching
of any kind. Every single one, therefore, is an
absolutely trustworthy record of a scene visible at a given
hour upon the African velt by day or by night. I insist
upon this point because herein lie both the value and the
fascination of my pictures.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span></p>

<p>In his introduction to the English edition of <i>With
Flashlight and Rifle</i> Sir Harry Johnston declares that
that work was “bound to produce nostalgia in the lines
of returned veterans”; I trust that <i>In Wildest Africa</i>
will bring also to such readers a breath from the wilderness
awaking in them memories of exciting experiences on the
velt. Above all, I trust that its appeal will be not to
grown readers alone, but that it will have still stronger
attractions for the coming generation.</p>

<p>A preface should not be too long. I shall conclude
with the expression of the hope that I may be able presently
to secure a new collection of “Nature Documents.”</p>

The Spell of the Elelescho</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">On</span> the afternoon of January 14, 1897, a small
caravan of native bearers, some fifty strong,
was wearily making its way across the wide plain towards
its long-wished-for goal, Lake Nakuro, which was at
last coming, into sight in the far distance. The appearance
of the bearers and their worn-out clothing showed
plainly that the caravan had made a long journey. And
so it was. Weakened by fever, I was coming from
the Victoria Nyanza in the hope of making a quicker
recovery in this more elevated district. As is the way
when one is convalescent, life seemed to me something
doubly beautiful and desirable now that, after lying
seriously ill for weeks, I was recovering from the fever.
I had been all but despaired of by the English officers
who had kindly taken care of me, Mr. C. W. Hobley
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
and Mr. Tompkins, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude.
I had caught the disease in the marshes of the Nyanza
and in my tramp through the wild Sotik and Nandi
country, then unexplored or very little known. During
the last few days our march had once more been imperilled
by hostile tribes, the rebel Wakamassia, but
this danger was all but past now that we were entering
the uninhabited region of the Nakuro, Elmenteita and
Naiwasha Lakes, in the district known to the Masai as
En’aiposha.</p>

<p>Endless undulating, expanses of grassy country, unadorned
by a single tree, had made our last days of
marching not too pleasant. Now there was a marked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
downward incline of the grass-covered plateau; it gradually
changed to a barren plain of volcanic origin, and the view
extended over the wide glittering lake.</p>

<p>Filling a far-stretching hollow, and lost to view on
the horizon, it lay at our feet, a welcome sight.</p>

<img id="i018" src="images/i018.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><small>MY BEARERS LOST NO OPPORTUNITY OF INDULGING IN THE ENJOYMENT OF A BATH.</small></p></div>

<p>The camp was pitched beside a parched-looking
’msuaki tree on the banks of a brook which at this time
of the year was a turbid torrent pouring itself down
towards the lake. Some time before, bush and grass fires
had raged in the neighbourhood and destroyed the old
grass, and here, it would seem, a heavy rainfall had
conjured forth for us a new carpet of grass that was fresh
and luxuriant. The remarkable luxuriance of the grass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
lands in the district had already been specially noticed,
and compared to the richest pastures of the Swiss Alps,
by the discoverer of, and first traveller in, this region,
Dr. G. A. Fischer, an explorer who, alas! so soon fell a
victim to the climate.</p>

<p>Fischer&mdash;in 1883&mdash;was the first to visit the neighbouring
Lake Naiwasha. How the situation has changed
since then! At that time, and thus only twelve years
before I first camped there, the warlike Masai still held
these wide uplands as absolute masters.</p>

<p>Oscar Baumann, an explorer who did good service,
was one of the first to traverse their inhospitable dominions.
It was some years after Fischer’s journey that Baumann
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
made his way into the region of the Nile sources,
during his famous expedition to legend-haunted Ruanda
(now better known to us through Dr. Richard Kandt’s
researches). I made his acquaintance at the Austrian
Consulate at Zanzibar. He, also, was snatched away in
his early years by the Sphinx of Africa, the treacherous
climate.</p>

FROM THAT SHOWN IN THE ILLUSTRATION AT THE END OF THE CHAPTER, WHICH REPRESENTS A MASAI ALREADY
INFLUENCED BY CIVILISATION.</small></p></div>

<p>His journey, only a few years before my stay here,
cost his numerous and strongly armed caravan hard
fighting with the natives. And now I am camping here
with a few men in an unfortified camp!</p>

<p>Fischer was quite convinced that he could not venture
upon his exploring journey without the support of the
Mohammedan trading caravans, but he had finally to
start alone with 230 bearers. Yet, notwithstanding all
difficulties, he successfully accomplished his task. But
how different from those of to-day were the circumstances
under which a journey was made into unknown Masailand
at that time! The Masai warrior was then still sovereign
master in his own land; he was still “Ol open l en gob”
(“Lord of the land”) in the full sense of the word. And all
the chivalrous poetry that has been so pathetically brought
home to us by the fate of the North American Indians, was
also not alien to his warlike character. Then came the
moment when he had to face the firearms of the Europeans.
His fate was sealed, like that of the lion and the leopard.</p>

<p>Then, too, tribute had to be arranged for on all sides.
Not only some of the petty chiefs in the neighbourhood of
the coast, but the Masai too, must receive costly payments.
Thus, for example, Dr. Fischer had to hand over to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
chief Sedenga at ‘Mkaramo on the Pagani River, to obtain
permission for the passage of his caravan, 100 pieces
of cloth, each six yards long, an axe, 100 leaden bullets,
one ten-pound keg of gunpowder, two large coils of brass
wire, and eight pounds’ weight of artificial pearls!</p>

<p>Only two kinds of caravans were known to the Masai,
slave caravans and trading caravans, which busied themselves
with collecting the coveted ivory tusks. The Arab
traders knew how to combine the two objects: the slaves,
the “black ivory” of the trade, were forced to carry the
white ivory down to the coast.</p>

<p>The strength of these trading caravans, well equipped
with firearms, always amounted to several hundred men;
but under certain circumstances these numbers were
considerably increased, so that caravans of a thousand men
or even more were not rare. It took Fischer long months
to recruit his caravan. The bearers did not like to undertake
the dangerous journey with the first white man who
started for that region. The jealousy of the Arab traders
was also at work. They feared that the channels of the
ivory traffic, which they carefully kept secret, might be
revealed.</p>

<p>The German explorer carried through his expedition
under the greatest difficulties. He returned home only
to succumb soon after to the extraordinary hardships
he had endured.</p>

<p>Fischer’s researches were of special importance in
connection with the ornithology of Masailand.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> His
journey gave to science some thirty-six hitherto unknown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
species of birds. Such a result must indeed command our
respect, when we consider the difficulties with which
the traveller had to contend, and especially when we
remember that his available resources were comparatively
trifling, beside, for instance, the abundant help that was at
the disposal of the English explorers of the same period.
The Geographical Society of Hamburg rendered him the
service of making the execution of his plans possible, and
for the same object Fischer expended all the money he had
earned in the active practice of his profession as a doctor
on the island of Zanzibar. He saw the activity he had
devoted to the service of scientific ideals richly rewarded
by the results he obtained. And then he had soon to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
succumb to the treacherous climate. But if his life was cut
short, how quickly the power of the Masai warriors was
broken, the very power that had so harassed him, and
made his journey so difficult and dangerous. That terrible
scourge, the cattle plague, probably introduced from
India, suddenly destroyed the greater part of the herds
of the Masai, and at the same time blotted out vast
numbers of the Masai themselves from the list of the
living.</p>

<p>The fates of these pastoral people and of their
property (the countless herds of cattle) were so closely
bound together, and these warlike herdsmen had become
so dependent on their droves of cattle, that once these
were ruined they could not survive, but died in a few
days of famine.</p>

<p>In the lapse of little more than a year the cattle plague
and the Black Death had swept over the Masai uplands.
Hungry vultures hovered over scenes of horror. The
herds of cattle fell under the strange pestilence. Agonised
by slow starvation, the herdsmen followed them to death.
I have often found lying together, in one narrow space,
the countless white bleached bones of the cattle and the
skull of their former owner. It would be an old camping-ground,
with its fence of thorns (zereba) long rotted
away, and it was now a strangely impressive Golgotha.
These heaps of bones, still to be seen in 1897, were soon
after dissolved in dust and scattered by the winds.</p>

<p>Where are the Masai of those days?</p>

<p>Suddenly they stand boldly before me, as if they
had sprung up out of the ground! It is no illusion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
But why do my bearers show no fear? Why does no
uproar break out in the camp?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i028" src="images/i028.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>MASAI HERDSMEN.</small></p></div>

<p>It is plain enough that no one troubles himself
about the appearance of these figures, for they come, not
threatening and demanding tribute, but conscious of the
overpowering might of the European. True, a few
months ago, not so far from my camp, their warriors
surprised and destroyed a caravan of nearly a thousand
coast folk. But, generally speaking, they do not care to
have to reckon with the superior weapons of Europe.
They even accept some food from me. And in this
matter they are not so dainty as they used to be in former
times, when the warriors&mdash;obedient to strict dietary laws&mdash;lived
only on the meat and milk of their herds. Of
course, here we have to deal with only a small number
of them. Yonder, on the wild uplands, there still live a
not inconsiderable number of Masai, who having saved
their herds, or got them together again, keep as far away as
may be from the Europeans and their uncanny weapons.</p>

<p>The Masai warriors, with their wives, children, and
herds, seem to me to be fit accessories for this desert
landscape. In the evening, dances amuse us till late in
the night, and many a wordy skirmish breaks out as some
of my bearers who, thanks to former journeys, have some
knowledge of the Masai tongue, gossip with these nomads
of the wilderness. The coast folk think themselves high
as the heavens above the “savage” Masai. The Masai
warriors, in return, despise the burden-bearing coast folk,
count them as “barbarians,” and scornfully call them
“il’meek.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>But the times have changed, and so it comes to pass
that my people too join in the dance, which lasts late into
the night: that songs of the warriors and the women&mdash;“‘Singolioitin
loo-‘l-muran” and “Loo-‘ngoroyok”&mdash;ring
out through the darkness, the chorus finding a manifold echo
with its oft-repeated “Ho! He! Ho! Na! He! Hoo!”
It is a “Leather Stocking” kind of poetry, and indeed
the redskins of the New World and the Masai here in
Dark Africa seem to me alike. The former had to yield
to civilisation, the same fate awaits the latter.</p>

<p>No one had the least anxiety about the night. We
quietly allowed the Moran<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> to bivouac near the camp.
Our march through the wild highlands of the Wasotiko
and the Wanandi had deadened our sense of such dangers.
We could have no forebodings of the fierce struggle
lasting for years that was yet to come between the
English troops and those peoples, or imagine how warlike
and skilled in self-defence they were. The presence
of hundreds of spear- and club-armed warriors in the
camp had become an almost daily experience, and great
was the surprise of the English officers, later on, when
they heard that the great caravan, which I had joined,
had had the good fortune to pass through these districts
without any fighting.</p>

<p>For me my serious illness had all at once interrupted
the austere and wild delights of this life of the march and
the caravan. But I had now become doubly responsive
to the joys of travel amid light and air, freedom and
endless space; doubly responsive also to the changing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>

impressions derived from my week of marching through
lonely primeval forests, bamboo thickets, and grassy
plains&mdash;scenes in which, as my friend Richard Kandt,
the discoverer of the source of the Nile, so strikingly
remarks,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> every plant, every stone, seems to cry out again
to one in the vast solitude but one word: “The desert!
the desert!”</p>

<p class="caption"><small>YOUNG MASAI DANCING AND SINGING NEAR MY CAMP.</small></p></div>

<p>In the early morning hours of January 15 there was
a light continuous rainfall. A short march of only two
hours brought us to our camping place on the shore of
Lake Nakuro.</p>

<p>Far away extended the panorama of the lake, which
lay before us filling its hollow bed, with its banks at this
season of the year yielding fresh pastures to numberless
herds of wild animals, and its waters affording rest and
food to countless members of the feathered tribe. I had
hardly ever seen greater numbers of the pretty little
dwarf gazelles (<i>Gazella thomsoni</i>, Gthr.). Thousands and
thousands more of these graceful creatures showed themselves
on the fresh, green, grassy meadows of the lake
margin, or scattered over its pebble beds of obsidian,
augite, and pumice-stone. Wherever one turned one’s
gaze it fell again and again upon these beautiful gazelles,
which in many ways reminded one of wild goats at
pasture, and were so strangely trustful that they often
allowed the spectator to come quite close to them.
Marked as are the colours of its hairy covering, the
dwarf gazelle does not stand out boldly from the background,
whether this be a plain blackened by bush-fires,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
or the mere bare ground, dun-coloured and brown, or
land covered with soft green grass. But how clearly
defined are its brown, black, and white, when we look
closely at the hide of a specimen we have secured, or
see it in a museum.</p>

<p>Darker spots in the distance far away from us we
take to be larger wild animals. The field-glass shows
that they are hartebeests, and a great number of waterbuck;
and still farther off there is a moving mass that
shimmers and is half lost in the glare of the morning sun.
There are zebras, and yet more zebras, moving like
living walls! Strange effects of light actually give us the
impression of something like a wall or rampart, made up
of the living forms of the zebras&mdash;the deep shadows they
throw come out black, their flanks are lighted up in the
dazzling sunshine, and they shimmer with all colours and
with ever-changing effect.</p>

<p>Here by the lake we have the characteristic mark of
the wilderness: dwarf gazelles and zebras, zebras and
dwarf gazelles in greater and greater multitudes! Wherever
the eye glances it falls upon these two species, and the
numerous waterbuck and Grant’s gazelles, and the
hundreds of hartebeests, are in a sense mere points of
relief for the sight amidst these vast crowds. Bathed
in the shimmering light this multitude of animals mingles
together. Wherever I make my appearance there is for
awhile movement in the mass of wild creatures, which
otherwise are grazing quietly. I have long since left the
camp a considerable distance behind me. I am following
One of the rhinoceros&mdash;or hippopotamus&mdash;tracks leading to

the lake margin, lost, so to speak, in this multitudinous
animal life, and once more I have the feeling of finding
myself, as it were, in the midst of a vast flock of sheep,
and the impression that all the creatures about me are not
“wild beasts,” but rather tame domestic animals that have
been driven out here to graze on the pastures under the
supervision of a herdsman.</p>

<p>The mass of animals surges and undulates to and fro.
Some old bulls of the heavily horned hartebeest species
seem to have undertaken the duty of sentinels. They
stand apart fixed and motionless, watching attentively the
strange appearance of the approaching man, and then
make away in a long striding gallop, with heads bent well
down, to increase the distance between themselves and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the suspicious object, ready all the while to give the alarm
signal for a general stampede by loud snorting. In this
district we do not find the flat-horned hartebeest of the
Kilimanjaro (<i>Bubalis cokei</i>, Gthr.), but the species
named after its discoverer, Jackson (<i>Bubalis jacksoni</i>).
Long and stately horns distinguish this variety of a
remarkably formed species of antelope, which is widely
distributed throughout Darkest Africa. To my great
delight I succeeded in bringing down a specimen of a
much more interesting species, Neumann’s hartebeest<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
(<i>Bubalis neumanni</i>, Rothsch.), then only known by one
or two examples.</p>

<p>Overwhelming in its vastness, its rich variety of
colour, form, and movement is the picture of animal life
thus displayed.</p>

<p>Moving along the hollows of the plateau hour after
hour, looking out from its ridges, now with the field-glass,
now with unaided sight, I find the whole grassy expanse
covered with these wild creatures. Hundreds and
hundreds more of zebras alternate with larger or smaller
herds of Grant’s gazelles. Near them, but keeping apart,
and all around them the dwarf gazelles are swarming.
Here and there one sees the proudly uplifted head of a
stately waterbuck, adorned with splendid branching horns,
and not far off his hornless doe, both of them in form and
action greatly reminding one of the stag, of our northern
lands. Occasionally the eye catches sight of splendid
black-plumed cock ostriches here and there on the plateau.
They watch the traveller carefully, and are accompanied
by their mates, which are very much more difficult for the
eye to make out owing to their plain grey plumage. On
all sides there are whole herds of brown hartebeests grazing,
resting, or making for some more distant spot with their
characteristic long striding gallop. And now one suddenly
comes upon a herd of giant eland antelopes, brownish
yellow, and adorned with white cross-stripes. Conscious
of their mighty strength, there is not much shyness about
them; but they know not the danger they run from the
long-range weapon of the European.</p>

<p>Think of all this animal life, bathed in the fulness of
the tropical sunlight! All depths and shades of colour
play before our eyes. Strongly cast shadows, ever changing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
with the position of the sun, alter again and again the
whole appearance of this world of life, and from minute
to minute it presents new riddles to any one who has not
had years of experience in the wilderness. When the
glittering light of the midday hours is tiring and confusing
the sight, one often can hardly tell for certain whether
it be a living multitude stretching out in the distance
before one, or whether the play of the sunlight is
imparting a semblance of life to scattered clumps of
thorn bushes.</p>

<p>Four rhinoceroses which I now descry moving across
the plain in the distance, and a flock of ostriches which
I can plainly make out with the field-glass, change shape
and colour so often that it is astonishing to see them.
According to their movements and position with respect to
the sun they appear to be of a blending blue and grey, or
intensely black, and then again almost invisible and the
colour of the earth, but always changing, always different
from what they were the moment before.</p>

<p>To realise all this one must in fancy place oneself in
the condition of exaggerated susceptibility to nervous
excitement that results from the intensity of the light,
together with the climate, and the unusual degree of
hardship. All this produces the greater effect because
one has to do one’s work in solitude and loneliness, and
is cut off from all interchange of ideas with one’s fellows.</p>

<p>Here, where the flora makes so poor a display, the
fauna is abundant. What a sight it affords for the
ornithologists!</p>

<p>Amongst the herds of zebras our European stork
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
together with its smaller African cousin, the Abdim stork,
is stalking in hundreds over the plain hunting for locusts.
In company with the storks I saw also great flocks of the
handsome crested crane engaged in the same occupation.
Or they rose in heavy flocks over the valleys with loud
and strangely discordant cries. Under the scanty shadows
of the mimosas the splendid giant bustards take their stand
at midday, erect, solemn, stiff-necked. At this time they
are not very wary, but in the coolness of the morning
and in the evening hours they soon get away to a safe
distance, either running with their quick mincing step, or
spreading their strong pinions for a short flight along
the ground. Their smaller relative, <i>Otis gindiana</i>, Oust.,
rose before me in the air, often throwing somersaults on
the wing like a tumbler pigeon. There is hardly any
other bird of its size that has such a mastery of flight.
Sea-eagles circled by the margin of the lake uttering their
beautiful clear-sounding cries. Heedless of their presence
thousands of splendid rose-red flamingoes soared up into
the deep blue dome of the sky, or lined the margin of
Nakuro, like a garland of living lake-roses, in company
with great flocks of ducks, geese, and waterside birds of
many kinds. Out of the clumps of acacias, and from
between the thickets of ‘msuaki bush by the lake, guinea
fowl and francolins rise, strung out in clattering flying
lines, and in the morning hours handsome sandfowl that
have come from far-off regions of the plateau sail by the
margin of the lake. Altogether an overwhelmingly rich
picture of warmly pulsating life and activity! The sight
of it all is indeed quite capable of impressing one with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the idea of flocks of wild creatures that have been
completely tamed; and once this idea has suggested itself,
the impression is so strong that for many minutes one
can believe in it!</p>

<p>Amidst all this wealth of “wild” life, which here seems
hardly to deserve the name of “wild,” it is much easier
to understand how primitive man in other continents
gradually secured domestic animals for his use, from the
vast range of choice thus presented to him.</p>

<p>But a strange feeling comes over the observer when
he remembers that out of all this wealth of animal life
the African has never been able to link one single creature
permanently to himself. He obtained his cattle and also
his goats and sheep from Asia. The camel may be left
out of account, for its connection with the human race is
lost in the mystery of primitive times. We may say that
the fauna of Africa has not given a single species to the
group of our domestic animals. It is sad and humiliating
to reflect that the men of to-day cannot accomplish what
was done in the dim past&mdash;granted that it took endless
ages in the doing.</p>

<p>There were times, as I have said, when I could not
get rid of this impression of <i>tame</i> herds of animals.
And this was all in a land, and a district, that left one
nothing to desire in the way of primitive wildness.
What, then, must it have been in early days when man
was not yet waylaying the beasts of the wilderness, or at
least had not yet employed the poisoned dart and spear,
the pitfall and the snare? It must have been a veritable
Garden of Eden. But here, far and wide, there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
nothing to be seen of man, only something that evokes
conjectures as to his former presence.</p>

<p class="caption"><small>GROUP OF MASAI, SHOWING THE HEAVY IRON ORNAMENTS WORN BY THE MARRIED WOMEN. IN THE BACKGROUND, ONE OF
THEIR HUTS, PLASTERED OVER WITH EARTH.</small></p></div>

<p>For suddenly from a height I notice a number of large
mounds, formed of stones, such as only the hand of man
could have built up. Under the secure protection of
these masses of rock&mdash;rough hillocks of heaped up stones&mdash;men,
who were once chiefs and elders of the Masai, sleep
their everlasting sleep. Their resting-places have been
so placed that they are not visible from any considerable
distance, but are hidden away in the hollows of the
ground. Out there in the wilderness, beneath the bright
blue sky, these simple old monuments speak to me most
impressively of the mighty harmony of everlasting change.
As chance will have it, I find not far from the graves a
human skull shining brightly in the sunlight and resting
on a projecting rock. It must have lain here very long,
as if keeping a look out on the old tomb of ol ‘loiboni,
the departed “wizards” of the Masai. The empty eye-holes
stare at the ancient grave.</p>

<p>But this symbol of the least is not obedient to the
spell of death that whispers here all night long, for it
has had to give shelter and protection to the rearing up
of new life. As my hand grasps the skull, now brittle
with decay, a family of mice takes to flight from inside
of it. They had set up their home in this bony palace,
and built their nest there.</p>

<p>And as if the Masai, resting probably for centuries
under these heaps of stone, had left their herds to me,
once more there surges around me this sea of animals.
Near at hand they are sharply defined against the ground,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
but farther off in the glittering light they grow indefinite.
How the whole flood of life contrasts with the grim
volcanic barrenness of the landscape!</p>

<p>At this moment my impression of vast shepherd-guarded
herds is deepened by the sudden appearance of
some spotted hyenas, scattering among the volcanic pebble
beds, and then running away over the plain, and seeming
to play the part of the shepherds’ dogs.</p>

<p>But where are the herdsmen of all these herds?
Immediately there comes an answer to my question.
Yonder, by the margin of the lake, in the distance, I see
little wreaths of smoke rising. The idea they give me
of herdsmen on the watch is to be quickly dissipated by
a report, not a loud one, followed by puffs of powder-smoke
that vanish quickly in the air. The shooting does
not disturb the animals that surround me. But then the
report is hardly audible, the little puffs of smoke barely
perceptible to the eye. I must find out who is disturbing
the peace. It is perhaps a caravan making for the
Victoria Nyanza. For we are upon the new “road”
to the lake&mdash;a road which is indeed still in the region of
projects, but which soon will be plainly marked with
railway metal.</p>

<p>The smoke puffs appear at markedly regular intervals
and as quickly disappear. I cannot understand it. For
a long time I keep my attention anxiously fixed on these
proceedings, all the while hurrying towards this remarkable
apparition. At last my field-glasses enable me to descry
a man, who from time to time drops on one knee to
take aim.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p></div>

<p>What in the world is he after?</p>

<p>As we draw closer, I am extremely surprised at seeing
that the man does not allow himself to be in the least
disturbed in his proceedings. Now his bullets begin to
whistle unpleasantly near me. I fire in the air, once,
twice.... Now his attention is attracted, and simultaneously
I perceive a number of dark objects near the
marksman. They seem to be his companions, black men,
and squatting on the ground.</p>

<p>From the background there emerge now great numbers
of such objects&mdash;it must be a large caravan.</p>

<p>The distance between us is diminished so that one can
see plainly.... Now we can shout to each other....
At last I learn that the hunter is marching with his long
caravan of bearers to the great lake. He has been putting
out all his exertions to shoot some wild animals. But
although he has many surprisingly interesting hunting
adventures to tell of as the result of his three months’
march from the coast to this point, that task seems to have
been beyond his powers! With a well-aimed shot he has
stretched on the ground just one single dwarf gazelle!!</p>

<p>After shaking hands, he bewails the fact that he has
a rifle that shoots so baldly. He says its system is
absolutely worthless, especially against wild animals.</p>

<p>Our fleeting acquaintance is broken off in a few
minutes. He is the first newly arrived European that I
have met for a long time, but I have not too much
sympathy for this class of sportsmen. So my new
acquaintance goes off, still blazing away freely. He has
been urged on by my information that his camping and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
watering, place for the day is a long way off, and that
the borders of the lake seem to me to be fever-haunted.</p>

<p>A queer kind of shepherd, in truth, for these wild
herds! I fear he would be very like a wolf, or rather&mdash;to
be zoologically and geographically precise&mdash;a leopard,
in sheep’s clothing!</p>

<p>Again I was alone; the disturber of my peace had not
frightened away the animals. So, as I was regaining
strength rapidly, I decided to halt here for a few days.
This meant having to provide for oneself in the most
primitive way, for I was short of some of the most necessary
provisions and supplies. But in such conditions the
decision was not difficult to take. I shall not easily forget
the days I spent there.</p>

<p>The plateau of the volcanic lakes Naiwasha, Elementeita
and Nakuro, standing nearly 6,000 feet above the sea,
presents to the spectator all the austere, stern, and strange
charm peculiar to the Masai uplands.</p>

<p>Some ten years have gone by since that expedition
of mine, and all is now changed. Up to that time only
the natives had lived in these districts. Few Europeans
had penetrated into these solitudes; but now a track of
iron rails links the Indian Ocean with the Central African
Lake basin, and the shrill whistle of the locomotive sounds
in the equatorial wilderness. Wherever the influence of
the railway extends, the Masai, whom I then learned to
know, have disappeared. Reservations have been assigned
to them, like the Indians of North America.</p>

<p class="caption"><small>BEARERS MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH HIGH GRASS.</small></p></div>

<p>My former companion on my travels, Alfred Kaiser,
describes, not without a certain feeling of sadness, how he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
saw them once more, not long, ago, under these new
conditions, already to a great extent changed by European
influence&mdash;and changed in a way that was not at all to
their advantage. Using, instead of the beautiful Masai
dialects, some mangled fragments of English, they scornfully
refused objects of barter that were eagerly coveted
ten years ago, and insisted on coined money. They no
longer wore their native ornaments, but were dressed in
European second-hand clothes. In a word they were
stripped of all the wild and primitive beauty that had once
distinguished them.</p>

<p>It is a hard fate, when a rude aboriginal people is all
of a sudden brought into touch with those of a high
degree of civilisation.</p>

<p>As the former lord of the land<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> was deprived of his
rights, so the same fate, more or less, befalls the splendid
animal world that lends its charm to these solitudes.</p>

<p>But then&mdash;ten years ago! I had been given back to
life after sharp suffering, and all that I was now allowed
to see in such rich abundance spoke to me in a more than
ordinarily impressive language, a language that seemed
to me to have an enduring charm.</p>

<p>And how clearly must this language have sounded in
the times of the primitive past!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>So we may here attempt a picture of the wild life of
the lake margin in former days, on the lines of the sketches
I have already traced out of the life and activity of the
wild herds of the plateau, as I still could see them....</p>

<p>Out of the many memories of those days, that still work
on me like magic, there is one above all that has a special
meaning, for me: “Elelescho!”</p>

<p>But what is “Elelescho”? the reader will ask. “Elelescho”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
is the name of a peculiar plant, perhaps it would
be more correct to say a bush, that has in many ways set
its mark on the flora in the very heart of the Masai region.
Ranges of hills covered with silvery-leafed Elelescho,
the spicy smell of Elelescho, the water at the camping
place redolent of Elelescho&mdash;and also, in consequence, tea,
coffee, cocoa tasting of Elelescho&mdash;that is a memory that
remains fixed firmly in one’s thoughts of this home of the
wild herds and of the Masai. It Was these disappearing
nomads who gave the bush its beautiful name.</p>

<p>Possibly the musical sound of the name has not a
little to do with reconciling us in memory to the plant.
For the bush itself has in process of time monotonous
effect not very to the senses, but for this very
reason all the stronger and more enduring. Its character
is connected by strong links of memory with our experiences
of those days, and the sound of its name awakes
rose-coloured recollections. For just as it is not given
to man to remember exactly the nature of intense bodily
pains, so fancy, looking backwards, kindly blots out much
that was hard and little that was pleasant in the life we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
have led. Thus it is that this strange bush, with its
silver-grey leaves and aromatic odour, is capable, as hardly
anything else is, of awakening in the mind of the traveller
a kind of nostalgia&mdash;nostalgia for the wilderness, to which
he is drawn by so much of beauty and of hardship. We
have gained very little by learning that botanists recognise
our plant as one of the Composit&aelig;, and name it
<i>Tarchonantus camphoratus</i>, L. It is to be found also
in other parts of Africa; and Professor Fritsch reported,
as early as 1863, that he found it growing in Griqualand,
then still an unsettled country, where it was called the
“Mohatla.” It would be a pity if its beautifully sounding
Masai name were not preserved for future times, and I
must do my best to save “Elelescho” from such oblivion.</p>

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>THE CARAVAN ON THE MARCH.</small></p></div>

<p>One must have learned the word with its sweet-sounding
pronunciation from the lips of a proud, handsome,
slender Masai warrior in order to understand how so
seemingly slight a thing can imbue one’s impression of a
whole land.</p>

<p>The Elelescho is as prominent in those regions as
the oak and beech or fir in Germany, or as the juniper,
the heath, and the broom, and has the same influence
on the landscape. But it has a greater and deeper
influence upon the imagination, because it so dominates
those solitudes, that to him who has long travelled in
them the mere memory of it evokes a vivid picture of
their once familiar aspect. The strong scent of the
Elelescho plant leads the Masai to wear the leaves of
the bush as a decoration round their ears for the sake
of its perfume. It belongs thus to the plants that because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of their scent are used as ornaments by warriors and
maidens: “Il-k&auml;k ooitaa ‘l muran oo ‘n&mdash;&mdash; doiye ‘l&mdash;&mdash;
or&ocirc;pili.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> So there pass before us Masai maidens, and
Masai warriors decked with Elelescho leaves and Elelescho
branches, and received with sympathetic smiles by the
caravan leaders&mdash;who, however, unlike the Masai, think
very little of it. Very simple and na&iuml;ve are the relations
of these natives with nature around them. Only the
obvious, the actually useful, comes into their thoughts,
and for my black companions the Elelescho always recalls
only memories of poor desert regions of the waste&mdash;regions
in which they must often endure hunger and suffer many
hardships. Far different is the influence of the Elelescho
region on my feelings. For me this bush is symbolically
linked with the plunge into uninhabited solitudes, with
self-liberation from the pressure of the civilisation of
modern men and all its haste and hurry.</p>

<p>We wish to feel once more, and to give ourselves up
fully to, the spell of the Elelescho&mdash;the charm of the
Elelescho thickets, that are also in South Africa in the
lands about the Cape the characteristic mark of the velt,
now so lonely, but once alive with hundreds of thousands
of wild herds.</p>

<p>A wonderful night has come on.</p>

<p>The moon&mdash;in a few days it will be at the full&mdash;sheds
its beams in glittering splendour over Lake Nakuro.</p>

<p>The little camp is soon wrapped in silence. The
weary bearers sink into deep and well-earned slumber.
Only the sentries, pushed far out, are on the alert. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
was but a few days since the rebel Wakamassia hillmen
were a source of danger to us, and nightly precautions
are not yet forgotten. The moonbeams flicker ghost-like
over the lake. Night-jars give forth their songs close to
the camp all round us. Strange sounds and cries ring
out from the throats of the waterfowl on the lake margins,
and not far away one hears the snorting of the hippopotami.
Jackals and spotted hyenas prowl round the camp,
betraying themselves by their voices. The hyena’s howl
and jackal’s wailing bark mingle strangely with the deep
bass note of a bull-hippopotamus. Here in the wilderness
there is hardly any sound that is louder than the mighty
voice of these giants of the water.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>A strange feeling came over me. Amid all the ever-varying
sensations of the last year my capacity for
enjoyment, my sensitiveness to outside impressions, had
been developed and enhanced. A short time since I was
between life and death, struggling with the treacherous
infection of fever. Now I was well. I was breathing
the air some three thousand feet higher than the place
where I lay ill near Victoria Nyanza. I was again in a
region whose vast volcanic solitudes contrasted strongly
with its abundance of highly developed organic life, and
exercised a strange influence upon me.</p>

<p>Is there such a place as Europe? Is it possible that
thousands of miles away there is a centre of civilisation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
whose teeming millions would fain imprint their image
on the whole earth, and even lay covetous hands on this
far-off wilderness, and that in time this must happen?</p>

<p>A world of which I myself am a unit! How strange
that I can delight so deeply in all this wild charm! And
how quickly the wishes of men change! A while ago,
in the long nights of fever, I had but one desire&mdash;that
my heart, my heart alone, should not be buried in a
foreign soil, but be taken back to the Fatherland.</p>

<p>And now, only a few weeks after my recovery, how
different seems to me all I may hope for from Fate, and
how much more complex, how much more difficult to
accomplish!</p>

<p>I yield myself up entirely to the spell of the wilderness,
to the mood of the night.</p>

<p>That was ten years ago, before the Europeans had
banished it&mdash;when it ached on the senses like the nocturne
of some great tone-poet. But I know well that to-day
it is no longer in existence; Lake Nakuro is now only
a lake like any other, and the railway whistle wakes its
echoes.</p>

<p>That night the spell must have been exceptionally strong.
It seemed to me as though I were under some charm,
as if I were carried back into the far-off times. There
came before my mind much of what the lake had seen
in the long vanished past. The lands around me heaved
and quaked. Mighty earth-shaping forces were doing
their work. I seemed to see before my eyes what
happened here in primeval times&mdash;how volcanic forces,
strange, boundless, and terrible, had built up and given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
form to the country around me here, destroying all living
things, and yet at the same time preparing the conditions
for the hotly pulsating waves of life of later days. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
my mind I saw pass before me wondrous mighty forms
of the animal world of the past, long since extinct.
Then&mdash;suddenly I started up. What was that?</p>

<p>A loud trumpeting ran in my ears! Elephants!
Were there still extant such herds of elephants as those
that I saw coming down there to the lake to drink, rolling
themselves in the mud of its banks, and openly making
friends with the hippopotami? Just as in the daytime I had
noticed the different kinds of antelopes and the zebras, so
here I saw again the elephants and hippopotami living their
life close together, moving round or beside each other
without fear or hesitation. The herd, numbering many
hundred heads, was guided to its drinking-place silently
and slowly by its aged leader, a female elephant of most
exceptional size. Many young elephants were there in
company with their mothers. Some very little ones, only
a few weeks old, played with their comrades, or knowingly
imitated the movements of the older animals in the water,
while the old ones took care to prevent the tender young
creatures from taking any harm.</p>

<p>But it all seemed somehow impossible! Veterans
among the most experienced black elephant-hunters had
assured me that such huge herds were not to be met
with. And if I saw aright in the shimmering moonlight,
what a great mass of hippopotami were moving about
there before me! And now, paying, no attention to the
elephants that were peacefully bathing farther out in the
muddy water, they clambered on to the land, and began
to graze like cows on the bank among some more of
the elephants. It was exactly the same friendly relation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
that I had seen between the dwarf gazelles and the zebras
during the day. Could I be only dreaming? Such a
multitude of huge creatures here close to my camp&mdash;it
could hardly be a reality!</p>

<p class="caption"><small>CRESTED CRANES AND ZEBRAS.</small></p></div>

<p>And now I perceived that a second herd of elephants,
some hundreds strong, was approaching the water. In a
straight line these still more giant-like colossi came down
to the lake margin&mdash;all of them, as I now clearly perceived,
bulls with mighty tusks, and amongst them some
quite enormous tuskers, obviously patriarchs of the herd,
and carrying some hundreds of pounds’ weight of ivory
that glittered afar in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The two herds greeted each other with their curious
cries, difficult to describe, and then the newcomers began
to bathe and drink.</p>

<p>My attention was especially arrested by some of the
elephants, clearly visible in the moonlight, keeping apart
from the rest. Standing together in pairs they caressed
each other with their trunks, while the enormous ears
which are such an imposing decoration of the African
elephant stood out from their heads, so as to make them
look larger than ever.</p>

<p>My wonder increases! Numerous herds of giraffes,
hundreds strong, come down to the lake, and this, too, not
far from the elephants, and without any fear.</p>

<p>And now there is again a new picture! A herd of
innumerable buffaloes. With their great formidable heads
turned watchfully towards the rest of the crowd, they too
are coming for a refreshing bath. Their numbers still
increase. It is a sight recalling, surpassing even, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
descriptions given by the first travellers over the velt
regions of Cape Colony.</p>

<p>How did all this accord with the reports I had received
of the scarcity of elephants? with the destruction of the
buffalo by the cattle plague? With my own previous
experiences? The most authoritative of my informants
had assured me that in this district the elephant was to
be found very rarely, the buffalo hardly ever!</p>

<p>Suddenly with mysterious swiftness the night is gone,
and the day breaks. I search for and find the tracks of
my giant guests of the night. I had made no mistake.
Monstrous footprints are sharply impressed in the mud,
the ground looks as it had been ploughed up, and in
the midst of the plain, not very far from the lake, there are
actually hundreds of mighty elephants standing near some
ol-girigiri acacias. As I begin to watch them, they
suddenly become restless. In their noiseless way they
make off at an extremely quick rate, and soon disappear
behind the nearest ridge.</p>

<p>Round about me I see herds of zebras, hartebeests, and
wild animals of all kinds in vaster numbers even than those
yesterday. The deep bellow of the wild buffalo breaks
upon my ear. I can see long-necked towering giraffes in
the acacia thickets. The snorting of numerous hippopotami
sounds from the lake. Some of these burly fellows
are sunning themselves on its margin; and quite close to
them several rhinoceroses are grazing peacefully in the
midst of their uncouth cousins.</p>

<p>I am surprised, too, at seeing a troop of lions disappearing
into the bush, after having made a visit to the water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
They are so close to me that I can plainly see by the shape
of their bodies that they are going home after having had
an abundant repast.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>A CAMP ON THE VELT.</small></p></div>

<p>The behaviour of my people puzzles me. I had no
opportunity for questioning them as to why they were not
more impressed by this unexpected spectacle, for my
attention was suddenly arrested by the appearance of a
lengthy caravan of bearers, that seemed as if it had
emerged before my eyes from the trampled ground.
There is new life and movement among the herds of
wild animals. Slowly, defiantly, or in swift-footed fear,
each according to its kind, all these wonderful creatures
seek safety from the approaching crowd.</p>

<p>A robust negro marches at the head of the caravan.
He carries a white flag inscribed all over with texts from
the Koran. Hundreds of bearers come steadily in. Each
carries a load of nearly ninety pounds’ weight, besides his
cooking gear, sleeping-mat, gun and powder-horn. At
regular intervals grave-looking, bearded Arabs march
among the bearers. Two stately figures, riding upon asses
and surrounded by an armed escort, are evidently the
chiefs, and a great drove of asses with pack-saddles laden
with elephant tusks brings up the rear. Very quickly the
numerous party establish their camp, and I now remark
that hundreds of the bearers are also laden with ivory. It
is clearly a caravan of Arab ivory-traders.</p>

<p>After the usual greetings&mdash;“Sabal kher” (“God bless
thee”), and “Salaam aleikum,” questions are asked in the
Swahili language: “Habari ghani?” (“What news?”) I
now learn that the party of travellers set out some two years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
ago from Pangani on the coast to trade for ivory in the
Masai country. I am surprised to hear the Arabs tell how,
although theirs is one of the first caravans that have made
the attempt, they have penetrated far into the inhospitable
and perilous lands of the Masai. Their journey has been
greatly delayed, for they have had to fight many battles
with the Wachenzi, the aborigines of the districts through
which they marched. “But Allah was with us, and the
Unbelievers had the worst of it! Allah is great, and
Mohammed is his prophet!”</p>

<p>Every one set busily to work. In the turn of a hand
the camp was surrounded with a thorny zereba hedge, and
made secure.</p>

<p>And now I had personal experience of what has passed,
times without number, in the broad lands of the Masai;&mdash;armed
detachments from the caravan started on raids for
far-off districts. The timid Wandorobo, that strange subject
tribe of the Masai, brought more and more ivory to
the camp to sell it to the traders, after long and obstinate
bargaining. It was remarkable how clever were the people
of the caravan in dealing with these timid wild folk, and
how well they knew how to gain their confidence.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> This
confidence, however, was not made use of in trade and
barter for the advantage of the natives. But thanks to the
methods and ways of managing the natives, as the traders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
understood them, we saw that the wild folk were quite
satisfied, and this was the main point.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>NATIVE SETTLEMENT WITH PALISADE AND ZEREBA (HEDGE) ON THE MIDDLE COURSE OF THE PANGANI RIVER. (PROTECTIVE
CHARMS ARE PLACED OVER THE GATEWAY AND IN FRONT OF IT, IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PICTURE.)</small></p></div>

<p>But what patience is required in trade of this kind! A
white man could never develop such Oriental patience.
Again and again a tusk would be endlessly bargained over,
till at last, often after days of chaffering, it passed into the
possession of the caravan. The natives were of course
bent on getting the tusks, sooner or later, into the camp.
At the very outset they had sent in a most exact description
of them, and then envoys from the caravan had to go and
inspect them, often at a distance of several days’ march
from the camp.</p>

<p>Every day a great number of Masai warriors appeared
in the camp. Men belonging to many kraals, owners of
great herds of cattle, camped near the lake. There were
not infrequent skirmishes, especially at night time. The
young warriors, the Moran, made attempts at plunder, and
were beaten off with broken heads. But, on the whole,
this hardly disturbed the good understanding. “It is their
testuri (custom),” thought the experienced and fatalistic
coast folk, and they accepted it as an unavoidable incident
of the trade. But festivals were also arranged, with dance
and song. In the still moonlit nights the strange chant
rang out in a high treble far over the plain, and sounded
in the rocky hills, and festivity and rejoicing reigned among
the warriors, the girls, and the women.</p>

<p>But by day one saw their busy life displayed, all the
bucolic poetry of grazing herds of cattle with their spear-armed
herdsmen. There was a great deal to be done, and
in each and every task the Masai girls and women showed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
themselves, like the men, excellent guardians and attendants
of their herds.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the Masai kraals the wild
animals of the plain mingled freely with the tame cattle
of the Masai, knowing well that the Masai folk would
not shoot them. The wild animals were exposed only
to the attacks of the Wandorobo. But these latter bore
themselves very shyly in the presence of their over-lords,
the Masai, and went off to far distant hunting grounds,
so that the wild animals were hardly ever disturbed by
a hunter.</p>

<p>The young Masai warriors also began to devote
themselves to hunting for ivory. With great courage,
and often with no small display of dexterity, they killed
a large number of elephants, allured by the high prices
offered by the caravans. But they kept the beautiful
tusks carefully hidden, buried in the earth till the moment
when they had successfully arranged a sale. The buried
treasure was easy to conceal. At the place where the
tusks were put away the grass was set on fire and burned
up over a considerable area, and then no eye could
distinguish the slightest indication of the buried treasure.</p>

<p>The Elmoran also made use of a method of hunting
which is employed in other parts of Africa, namely, to slip
quietly up to an elephant, and with a single powerfully
delivered sword-cut sever the tendon Achilles. But few
indeed were daring enough to attempt this, and these were
strong, brave, and well-trained warriors. Such an exploit
won for them high respect among their comrades of
the clan.

<p>While the Masai warriors thus took their share in
elephant-killing, and the Wandorobo stuck to their long,
trusted poisoned darts and poisoned spears, the caravan
folk attacked the elephants with powder and iron bullets,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
and slew whole hecatombs of them.</p>

<p>“Nowadays,” the leader of the caravan told me, “the
chase is easier and less dangerous, and your firearms also
give the man from the coast the power of hunting and
killing the Fihl (elephant). For example, you know, sir,
that my half-brother, Seliman bin Omari, is not a practised
hunter. And yet, believe me, he and his people have
brought down many, many elephants.”</p>

<p>But his banker on the coast, the Hindoo Radda Damja,
certainly never hears one word of any elephant being killed
by Seliman’s people:</p>

<p>“No one is so clever as he is at knowing nothing
about elephants when questions are asked. The ivory is
always something traded for with the natives, far, far away
in the interior,” he adds, with a cunning wink. “The
main point is that we all get pembe (ivory), and he gets
plenty of it! I would like to work the business as he
does, but, sir, I am not so clever in preparing amulets, and
moreover, I don’t know as much as he does of the ways
of the elephant.</p>

<p>“But it’s a pity that in all parts of the country the ivory
is becoming very scarce, so one has to be going always
farther into the interior, and one must try to find new ivory
districts.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>Thus my Arab informant talked a long time with me.
He told me much that was interesting and much that was
new to me. He told me of caravans that had been
massacred, cut off to the last man by the natives in remote
districts: and again of caravans that had been not one or
two,&mdash;no, as long as six years on the march, that had
buried a lot of ivory and gradually got it down to the coast.
Time counts for nothing here, for the people&mdash;that is to say,
those who are not slaves&mdash;receive only the one lump sum
agreed upon for the journey, no matter how long it lasts.
His friends, with caravans mustering many hundreds, had
carried hundreds and hundreds of barrels of gunpowder
into the interior, they had sought everywhere for new
districts abounding in ivory, and the result had been the
slaughter of the elephants on all sides. Nevertheless he
had not much to tell me of men having enriched themselves
by this trade. However, this did not apply to the traders
on the coast, who advanced the money. These lent money
to the caravan leaders, who went into the interior, at the
high rate of interest usual in the East, and thus became
rich men. They had, of course, also many losses. It
happened not seldom that one of their debtors was “lost”
in the interior, which means that he simply did not come
back, but chose to pass the rest of his life in exile. And
in that case it would be a difficult matter for the creditor
to take proceedings against him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i096" src="images/i096.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="hang"><small>A MASAI DANCE&mdash;THE PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS THE PLAITED QUEUE WORN BY THE YOUNG WARRIORS (EL MORAN), WHO LEAP
AS HIGH IN THE AIR AS THEY CAN. THE YOUNG WOMEN, WHOSE HEADS ARE CLIPPED COMPLETELY BARE, SING AND
DANCE ROUND THEM.</small></p></div>

<p>Then my informant told me how many of the elephant
hunters still living had been carrying on their business
already for a long time before any Europeans whatever
thought of making a prolonged stay in the country. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
told me also much that was interesting about the old trade
routes extending far through Africa, and even to the
Congo. He had friends and relatives who had already
traversed these routes many times, and journeyed from
the east coast even to the Congo, long before any
European traveller. Many of the people of his caravan
were able to tell from memory each day’s journey as
far as the Congo, and give exact information about the
chiefs who held sway in each district, and the possibility
of getting supplies of various kinds of provisions,
such as maize, millet, bananas, or other products of the
country.</p>

<p>I cannot exactly say how long he had talked with
me about elephants and elephant-hunting, about the ivory
trade, and many other things. I only know one thing&mdash;that
after some time his talk became more and more
difficult for me to understand, that I strove in vain against
an ever-increasing weariness, and that at last I saw neither
the Arab nor the caravan&mdash;in a word, saw nothing more,
felt nothing more.</p>

<p>I fell into a deep sleep in which, in my dreams, I had
a lively argument with some Europeans, who would not
believe so many elephants, buffaloes, and other wild
animals had formerly been here, and who kept on objecting
strongly that it was impossible that all this could have
been the case so short a time ago.</p>

<p>When I woke up again I found myself in my lounging-chair,
a primitive piece of furniture of my own construction.
My black servant stood before me, and asked me if I
would not rather go to bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes&mdash;it had all been a dream, then; the
spell of Elelescho must have inspired me with it. How
foolish to yield to this spell! But men will perhaps so
yield to it when all this has become “historical” and
the Masai and their lives and deeds have, like the Redskins
of America, found their Fenimore Cooper.</p>

<p>Then may the spell of the Elelescho exert its rightful
power; then may it make famous the slender, sinewy, noble
Masai ol-morani as, amidst his fair ones, his “doiye,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> he
leads the song-accompanied dance as he goes out to war,
and reigns the free lord of the wilderness! But to-day he
bears on his brow the significant mark of an inexorable
fate&mdash;that of the last of the Mohicans.</p>

<p>The spell of the Elelescho has departed from Lake
Nakuro, once so remote from the world.</p>

<p>The lake is no longer remote.</p>

<p>Iron railway lines link it with the Indian Ocean.
Vanished from it is the spell that I once felt both waking
and sleeping; gone is the poetry of the elephant herds,
the Masai, the Wandorobo, and the caravan life in all
its aspects; gone all that I saw there. The traveller,
if he would learn to know the primitive life and ways,
whether of men or of the animal world, if he would know
the primeval harmony that speaks to him in an overpowering
language peculiar to itself, must press on
into the wilderness farther away from these tracks.
This harmony, whose special character is day by day
disappearing, day by day is in an ever increasing measure
destroyed, cannot be recalled under the new, the coming

system, the system that abandons itself to restlessness&mdash;that,
in a word, which we call modern industry, modern
civilisation.</p>

<p>To-day one may perhaps read in the <i>East African
Gazette</i> that Mr. Smith, the railway engineer, favoured
by extraordinary luck on a hunting expedition, has seen
one solitary bull elephant not far from Lake Nakuro!
This is something quite out of the ordinary, and Mr. Smith
is to be congratulated. Unfortunately his efforts during
many years to have even one young East African elephant
sent to London have been without any result. A young
animal is no longer to be found. In the same number
of this newspaper, under another heading, we read the
report that the export of ivory this year by the Uganda
Railway has been utterly disappointing; the quantity carried
has been terribly small, hardly worth mentioning!</p>

<p>I had a talk lately with a travelling companion who
had spent some time with me in the wilderness ten years
ago, and who had just revisited those distant lands, availing
himself of the railway. Alfred Kaiser, a widely travelled
man, recalled to me the life we had lived together, when
there was yet hardly a trace of European influence among
the people of the interior by Lake Victoria. In memory
we saw again the inhabitants of then hardly known
Sotikoland receiving us mistrustfully on their frontier,
thousands strong. Their glittering spears sparkle in the
morning sun; chiefs, ministers, and court ladies of the
Wakawir&oacute;ndo appear in camp in most primitive costume;
club-armed warriors regard us with the most open distrust;
cowry shells and artificial pearls form their costume and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
are used as their money; sudden attacks and fighting are
quite in the order of the day.</p>

<p>And now, only ten years later, Kaiser has seen the
Masai at Lake Nakuro, English-speaking caricatures of
civilisation.</p>

<p>A feeling of something like resentment comes upon
the traveller who has had to pay toll for his journey
with the ceaseless sweat of his brow, when he thinks
that now any one can reach Lake Nakuro in a few
days from the coast. It is true that the over-anxious
globe-trotter is kept in check by only too well justified
fears of the treacherous malaria and the sleeping-sickness
that has made such terrible progress of late. Otherwise
the railway journey from Mombassa to the Victoria
Nyanza, and then down the Nile to Cairo, would be a
much-travelled route.</p>

<p>I have tried to describe, in brief outline, the rapid,
unwelcome change of our time, the result of European
civilisation forcing its way in. As I describe things, so
they were half a century ago, and even yet ten years ago,
when I stayed by the shores of Nakuro, and no railway
had yet been made there.</p>

<p>To-day one can no longer find the old spell of the
Elelescho there, or anywhere else where the white man
has penetrated.</p>

<p>The traveller probably sees only a shrubby plant.</p>

<p>It covers many a ridge, and the lonely plains of the
uplands, and sends afar its spicy perfume. The botanists
call it <i>Tarchonantus camphoratus</i>, L. They class it among
the Composit&aelig;.

<p>But here it can no longer exercise any spell.</p>

<p>That has flown far, far away, into the interior. There,
where the white man has not yet come, it still prolongs
its existence.</p>

<p>How long, yet will it be before it has entirely departed?</p>

From the Cave-dweller’s Sketch to the
Flashlight Photograph</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> mysterious charm of wild nature, undisturbed,
almost untouched, by the hand of man,&mdash;the charm
inherent in all that I have in mind when I talk of “the
spell of the Elelescho”&mdash;explains the keen and profound
interest with which my pictures of animal life were
received at home.</p>

<p>In these days, when even electricity has been harnessed
by men, there is a feeling that the knell has been sounded
of all that is wild, be it man or beast. And however
unpretending and inadequate the little pictures might be
that I had won from the wilderness, yet all nature-lovers
felt that they had here before them authentic, first-hand
records revealing secrets which the eye of man had never
before looked upon, or had had but scant opportunity for
studying.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>These pictures were the first to show really wild
animals in full freedom, just as they actually live their
life on velt and marsh-land, in bush, forest, air, and
water. They showed nature in its unalloyed reality, and
therefore a peculiar stamp of truth and beauty must have
imprinted itself upon them. They came, too, as a surprise,
for in many points the hitherto accepted representations
of the animal world and those given by my photographs
did not agree.</p>

<p>Mere subject counts for so much in a picture with
most people that it takes them a long time to appreciate
a work of art the subject of which does not at the first
glance appeal to them. This applies peculiarly to my
African photographs. It is not a very easy matter for
the eye to grasp the movements of the varying forms of
animal life in their natural freedom. Often their appearance
is so blended with their surroundings that it requires
long practice to distinguish the individual characteristics
of each, the fleeting graces of their momentary aspects.</p>

<p>I could not, therefore, help feeling a certain apprehension
that every one would not at once be able to understand
and decipher my pictures in my book, <i>With Flashlight
and Rifle</i>. It is necessary when one looks at them to
understand, in some degree, how to read between the
lines; one must make an effort to grasp their more
elusive features; in short, one must devote oneself to the
study of them with a certain gusto, a certain intelligence.
There was a further difficulty arising from the fact that
the illustrations could be reproduced only by a process in
which unfortunately much of the finer detail of the originals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
is lost. The use of the process, however, was necessary
for various reasons.</p>

<p>There can be only two ways of securing the best
possible result in the execution of pictures of such subjects.
The ideal method would be for heaven-sent artists, after
years of study, to give us works of this class, and combine
in these masterpieces the strictest truth with the finest
craftsmanship. But this requires a thorough study of
each separate species of animal seen from afar and at
close quarters&mdash;and how is this possible, seeing that one
gets only momentary glimpses? The other method is
that of photography, the picture on the negative, which
can claim the advantage of documentary accuracy, and at
the same time leaves a certain scope for the artistic sense
of the operator. So the greatly improved photographic
methods of to-day can step in, at least as a substitute and
makeshift, in the absence of works of art such as the
genius of one man may give us. Considering the
extreme difficulty of taking portraits of living animals in
their wild, timid state, such pictures can only in a few
instances lay claim to technical photographic perfection.
But at least so far as my own taste goes, a certain lack of
sharp definition in the picture (often deliberately sought
for in taking other objects) is not only no disadvantage,
but is even desirable. As a confirmation of this idea of
mine, I may mention the opinion of an American journalist,
who declares that my picture of a herd of wild animals
given on page 327 of <i>With Flashlight and Rifle</i> to be the
most perfect thing of the kind he has seen, and the most
pleasing to him, and compares it to the work of a Corot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i114" src="images/i114.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><small>PICTURE OF A FEMALE HIPPOPOTAMUS FROM LE VAILLANT’S BOOK OF TRAVELS,
PUBLISHED MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.</small></p></div>

<p>It must be noted that <i>if the animals are drawn so as
to stand out separated from the landscape which is a needful
accessory of the picture, and brought forward into the
foreground in an obviously selected pose, they must appear
unnatural to the eye of the expert</i>. Such pictures cannot
fail to give an unnatural impression, for in the freedom
of the wilderness the animal world never presents itself
in this way to the eyes of man. In their full significance
as masterpieces of nature, all the various aspects of the
animal world are first manifested to us in close connection
with their environment. It has been a keen satisfaction
to me to find that many world-renowned artists have
appreciated warmly the beauty of these photographs, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
have given expression to this feeling. I have been told,
for instance&mdash;what I myself had already noticed&mdash;that
numbers of the pictures, especially, those showing birds
on the wing, bear a great resemblance to certain famous
works of Japanese painters<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> of animal life, works that
seem to dive into the secrets of nature. It has been
brought home to me, indeed, both by hundreds of letters
and thousands of opinions expressed in conversation,
that the pictures have excited almost universal interest,
and that my labours have not been in vain.</p>

<p>Fully to enjoy the peculiar beauty of such photographs
of living wild animals, the best way is undoubtedly to see
the pictures considerably magnified by means of the magic
lantern. On account of the special character and strangeness
of most of the objects shown, I have the lantern slides
lightly tinted. This colouring can be done without in
the least altering the picture in its details, and its object
is merely to secure greater effectiveness. Approval from
all sides, both from artistic circles and from the public,
satisfies me as to the correctness of this proceeding. Only
in this way do photographic pictures shown by transmitted
light produce the full impression of beauty and naturalness;
they seem to transport the spectator directly to the far-off
wilderness.</p>

<p>There must be some good reason for the widespread
interest manifested in these pictures of the life and ways
of animals, some of them still so little known, and all of
them living in remote solitudes. It seems to me that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
cause is deep-seated&mdash;that deep down in the heart of the
highly-cultured civilised man there are involuntary yearnings
after the sensations of wild, healthy, primeval nature.
The progress of mankind from the so-called barbaric stage
to the highest civilisation has been accomplished in so
short a time, in comparison with the whole period of man’s
existence, that it is easy to understand how such a longing
may survive. In every man there must be something
of this craving for light and air and primeval conditions.</p>

<p class="caption"><small>A GERMAN PICTURE OF THE GIRAFFE DATING FROM ABOUT TWO HUNDRED
YEARS AGO.</small></p></div>

<p>“The conflict of man with the animal world,” says
Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche, “has passed away unsung and uncelebrated.
The civilised man of to-day has hardly a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
recollection of the endless lapse of time during which
mankind had to struggle with the beasts of the earth
for mastery.” Let us for a few moments turn our gaze
backwards to that far past. In epochs that the learned
date back by hundreds of thousands of years, we find
attempts made by the cave-dwellers to execute artistic
representations of nature as they saw it. The artist of
prehistoric times set to work with his rude instruments
to draw in merest outline on a smooth rock-face, on a
tusk taken in the chase, or on some such material, the
things that had particularly attracted his thoughts or
stimulated his efforts. Specimens of these primitive works
of art have been handed down to us. In the first place
there are pictures of animals, scratched upon ivory, and
notwithstanding all their crudeness, sketched with sufficient
ability to enable us to-day to recognise with certainty the
objects which the artist tried to depict. Such sketches
scratched on ivory, showing various kinds of animals
(some of them now extinct) and forming the oldest documents
of the animal-sketcher’s art, have been found in
the caves of the south-west of France, in the old dwelling-places
of the so-called “Madeleine” hunters of La
Madeleine and Laugerie Basse. The museum at Zurich
also possesses similar primitive documents from the
Kesslerloch cave, near Thaingen, in the canton of
Schaffhausen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><small>HOTTENTOT HUNTERS&mdash;A SKETCH DATING FROM 200 YEARS AGO.</small></p>

<p class="hang"><small>(Some South African tribes actually hunt the lion on foot with javelins,
and I have myself more than once observed the courage of the East
African natives in similar circumstances.)</small></p></div>

<p>It is indeed not surprising that the cave-dweller of
those days took his models from the ranks of the animal
creation. All his thoughts and efforts were directed to
the chase; he had no resources but in this pursuit, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
he had to carry on, day and night perhaps, a fierce struggle
for existence with wild beasts. One can thus follow the
development of the human race through the course of
time from the primitive sketches of beasts down to our
own days, in which it has been reserved for the hand
of man to execute masterpieces inspired by genius, and
in which man makes the sun to serve him in depicting
and preserving representations of all that lives and moves,
creeps and flies. By means of the sketches of animals
laboriously scratched on pieces of ivory by the Cave men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
of Southern Europe, we make the acquaintance of the
long-haired prototypes of the living elephants of to-day.
These animals were the most coveted big game in Europe.
Clearly recognisable sketches of reindeer tell us that a
climate like that of the northern steppes prevailed at the
time; others of horses show that the wild horse was then
to be found in Europe; those of the aurochs prove the
existence of that animal. There is a remarkably close
resemblance between the style of all these drawings and
that of the rude sketches made by the Esquimaux of our
own day. Some such Esquimaux sketches of animals on
walrus tusks, at the most a hundred years old, are to be
found in the Berlin Ethnographical Museum. Interesting,
too, are the sketches of giraffes from the hands of ancient
Egyptian artists. They show us that the artist of those
days in drawing animals allowed a loose rein to his fancy
and imagination. Thousands of years must separate these
representations of animals from the sketches of Asiatic
wild life which Sven Hedin discovered at Togri-sai-Tale
near L&ocirc;b-nor. They are scratched on bright green slate,
and depict yaks, wild asses and tigers, and the hunting
of them with bow and arrow. They appear to be of the
same kind as the animal-sketches made by the South
African Bushmen, discovered by Fritsch in the year 1863.
These cave pictures show us various members of the fauna
of Cape Colony, which has already been to so great an
extent exterminated. During the period of the Middle
Ages a more perfect style of representing animals was
gradually evolved, but even about the year 1720 we find
representations that are inaccurate to an incredible extent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
and, indeed, so recently as the early part of last century,
one sees in the travels of the French naturalist Le Vaillant,
in the picture of a female hippopotamus, a proof that the
development of animal-drawing had as yet made little
progress.</p>

<p>But what a difference in drawing and technique has
come about in less than a hundred years! One need only
compare the pictures of those times with the works of our
own days, to be convinced that, besides artistic execution,
there is now an increasingly exacting demand for the
precise truth. Indeed, one of the first points to be insisted
on is that photographic pictures <i>shall not be altered,
worked up&mdash;in word, in any way “retouched.”</i> Only
on this condition can they really claim to be&mdash;that which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
in a special sense they ought to be&mdash;<i>true to nature,
absolutely trustworthy “nature-documents.”</i> This distinguishes
the photograph from works of art executed by
the hand of man, which must conform to each individual
conception of the artist.</p>

<p>It is a hard saying that the modern cultured man is
becoming, continually more and more estranged from
nature. But in this matter let us take the standpoint
of the optimist, who says to himself that there must be
a reaction&mdash;a conscious, deliberate return, which indeed
will represent the result of the highest stage of culture.
There is an increasing perception of the existence in our
home landscape of an ideal worth, that we have not
yet been able sufficiently to estimate. To-day already
there is a movement on all sides, and the demand is heard,
ever stronger and clearer, for the protection of the beauties
of nature. We must protect Nature in the widest sense
of the word. And even if, in the stern progress of
evolving civilisation, much that remains in the treasury
of primitive nature must be destroyed, we shall be able
long to preserve and rejoice in much else.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i124" src="images/i124.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><small>A SMALL HERD OF FEMALE BLACK-TAILED ANTELOPES RUNNING AWAY THROUGH
HIGH GRASS.</small></p></div>

<p>And here come into play the healthy desire of man
in his primitive state, the cry for light and air, and all
the beauty of nature. It is hardly a hundred years since
we in Europe learned to value the landscape beauties of
unspoilt nature. English writers of travels a century ago
still spoke of Switzerland with aversion; it was for them
a horrible, dismal mountain country. And it is easy to
understand how man in his hard struggle for the
necessaries of life regarded, and was forced to regard,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
nature around him as on the whole unfriendly and
menacing. But since those times there has been a
change for the better, even though it cannot be denied
that many men require very specially adjusted spectacles
to enable them to enjoy this or that beauty of the nature
around them! Thus the landowner feels a pleasing
satisfaction at the sight of his cornfields. And yet these
cornfields are hardly anything else but an artificially formed
bit of bare velt, on which at certain times a short-lived
vegetation grows up, whilst at other times the naked soil
presents itself to the eye&mdash;uninviting, stripped of all
adornment, arid and empty. Thus, too, the man who
loves wine feels that well-cultivated vineyards are a
beautiful sight; but it may be doubted whether he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
do so if, say, only cotton-pods grew on the vines! In
ancient times, as Humboldt shows, with the Greeks and
Romans, as a rule, only country that was “comfortable
to live in” was called beautiful, not what was wild and
romantic. Yet Propertius<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and many others praise the
beauty of nature left to itself, in contrast with that which
is embellished by art. Then we have a long way to
travel through the Middle Ages, when the Alps are
described to us as “dismal” and “horrible,” till we come
to the nature-studies of Rousseau, Kant, and Goethe.
At first there were very few to sympathise with them.
Their view gradually prevailed, in spite of many backward
eddies. Thus Hegel had only one impression of the
Swiss Alps, that of a performance tiresome on account
of its length&mdash;a judgment not far removed from that
of the Savoyard peasant who declared that people who
took any interest in snow-covered mountains must be
insane.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we find in Eastern Asia, and
especially among the Japanese, from the earliest times,
the most ardent love for nature, and there even the poorest
knows how to adorn his home with flowers, and to turn
the beauty of the landscape to similar account.</p>

<p>A great part of the interest felt in natural beauty is
perhaps to be traced to extraneous considerations. On
the other hand, here in Germany we see most of our
people full of feeling for our glorious forests and for
our German scenery in general. We have to face the
prospect, however, of a silenced countryside&mdash;a countryside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
without song or music.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> That is a matter for anxiety.
Insects, birds, quadrupeds, life and movement should be
a part of the landscape. This idea should continue to
attract more and more adherents. German thought and
feeling are altogether in unison on this subject, and it is
to be hoped that the cry for the protection of the beauties
of nature, for the preservation of the plant and animal
worlds, and all that is picturesque in our native landscape,
may continue to find expression. The League for the
Preservation of the Homeland in Germany gains daily
new supporters.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>BEARERS ON THE MARCH.</small></p></div>

<p>Men like Professor Conwentz and many others have
been working for years in this direction, and carrying
on a most successful propaganda. This action for the
preservation of the Homeland, taken in the highest and
broadest sense of the word, must tend to evoke and foster
the love of nature and its beauties in ever wider circles.</p>

<p>In other countries, too, steady progress is being made
towards the same goal, and the importance of these
considerations has long been recognised. In England and
in America a way has recently been found to give practical
effect to the idea of the protection of the beauties of
nature by measures well calculated for this end. In this
connection, too, a refined &aelig;sthetic culture is gaining
ground. I do not at all close my eyes to the difficulty
of regulating the conditions bearing on this matter. But
in this connection we must not shrink from decisive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
measures. Those who come after us will be the first to
prize and esteem these measures at their full value.</p>

<p>What I have here described as something to be desired
and worth striving for at home must also hold good for
the whole world&mdash;the preservation of all that is characteristic,
all that belongs to primitive nature, wherever it
is to be found.</p>

<p>The beauties of nature are most abundant, and in our
time they are all&mdash;all&mdash;threatened with destruction and in
need of protection. Where we can save and preserve
any of them, our hands should not remain idle.</p>

<p>But where this is not possible, let us secure “nature-documents,”
paintings, representations of all kinds as true
to life as may be.</p>

<p>In this way we shall, at least, save for future ages
memorials of enduring worth, for which our children’s
children will give us thanks.

New Light on the Tragedy of Civilisation</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Theodore Roosevelt</span>, President of the
United States of America, says in his lately published
work, <i>Out-door Pastimes of an American Hunter</i>:
“The most striking and melancholy feature in connection
with American big game is the rapidity with which it
has vanished.”</p>

<p>He makes a critical investigation of this disturbing
fact, and he most strongly advocates restrictive laws and
the establishment of reservations for wild animals. He puts
himself at the head of every effort directed towards the
protection, as far as may be, of the animal world and of
wild nature, and shows by word and deed how even in
a brief period remarkable results can be obtained in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
direction. At the same time, on every page of his
striking work, the President shows that he is in favour
of the practice of the chase within proper limits, and thus
he by no means takes the side of extreme partisans in
this matter. His efforts are of the greatest service to the
cause, and will no doubt have extremely valuable results
in the United States, where, owing to its peculiar circumstances,
the natural treasures of the country were, till very
lately, recklessly wasted.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Yellowstone National Park
was largely the President’s work. In this vast territory
no shot may be fired. It forms an inviolable national
sanctuary, within whose boundaries life of all kinds is safe.
Several similar reservations are already established, or their
establishment is projected. Strict protective laws have
been some of them brought into operation throughout the
States, and some of them gradually extended to various
districts according to their circumstances. Whole tracts
(as, for instance, Alaska) have been closed for years by
law against the hunter. In short, a period of thoughtless
ravage has been followed by an era of self-control with a
swiftness that no one would ever have expected under
the conditions prevailing in America.</p>

<p>The facts I have noted give one something to think
about. When in such vast regions of the world measures
of this kind are found to be necessary, there must have
been strong grounds for them. And, in fact, primitive
nature and all its glories were in as serious peril in the
United States as in many other parts of the world.
The cutting down of enormous stretches of forest, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the destruction of the stately representatives of the animal
world, went on at giant speed in the United States. The
almost complete extinction of the splendid American bison,
that once roamed in millions over the prairies of the
United States, is one of the most startling facts illustrating
the destruction of wild animals through the introduction
of civilisation. This fact had no slight influence in procuring
the enactment of severe measures.</p>

<p>In a land like the United States such measures are
possible, advantageous, and practicable. In other countries,
too, which are in a settled condition, similar
regulations have everywhere come into force of late years.
Thus, for instance, the remnants of the fauna of Australia
are now protected by stringent laws. But quite different,
and much more difficult, are the conditions of the problem
with regard to Africa. There, more than anywhere else,
the time has come for protective regulations. But how
can these measures be enforced, however well they may be
thought out? We must keep before our eyes the terrible
example of the disappearance of the animal world of
South Africa, as the result of the extremely rapid spread
of civilised life. We can now, with the help of statements
made by trustworthy writers, survey the various phases of
this utter destruction of animal life during the last century,
and so form an idea of what awaits other parts of the
Dark Continent.</p>

<p>Powerful voices have been raised of late in favour of
the preservation of African wild life, and this especially
in England. In this respect, Mr. Edward North Buxton
is most prominent in pressing for thorough measures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
of protection for the African fauna, throughout the wide
possessions or spheres of interest of the British Empire.
In England, too, many strong pleas have been made in
support of the view that even relatively speaking noxious
animals should not be deprived by man of the right to a
certain amount of protection. Thus Sir H. H. Johnston,
the former Governor of the Uganda Province in Central
Africa, says in his preface to the English edition of my
book <i>With Flashlight and Rifle</i>, that in his opinion the
weasel, the owl, and the primitive British badger of the
existing fauna ought not to be entirely sacrificed to
the pheasant&mdash;a beautiful enough bird, but, after all, one
that must always remain an “interloper”; that the egret,
the bird of paradise, the chinchilla, the sea-otter,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and
such-like creatures are “&aelig;sthetically as important,” and
have the same right to existence, as a woman beautifully
dressed in the spoils of these animals. Good pioneer
work in this direction must result from the noble-hearted
resolve of the Queen of England to put herself at the
head of the “Anti-Osprey Movement,” organised to save
the royal heron from threatened extinction.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the complete extermination
of any species of animal must excite in the mind of a
reflecting man a sense of injustice and wrong; and that
this complete destruction of certain species can only be to
the interest of all men in general when such animals, of
whatever kind they may be, are entirely noxious and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
quite useless. No epoch in the world’s history can be
set in comparison with ours in so far as it has been the
witness, in the course of a few decades, of almost daily
progress and improvement in connection with industry,
culture, and the whole field of human knowledge. And,
moreover, no epoch has been so penetrated with the
great thoughts of progressive humanity. The continual
employment&mdash;in ways that are ever more adroit, ever
more complex&mdash;of all the resources offered by nature to
man, seems at the same time to blind him to certain
grave misdeeds that he is actually perpetrating every day.
These great crimes against the harmony and order with
which nature surrounds us&mdash;crimes that it is not easy to
make any amends for&mdash;are the disfigurement and poisoning
of watercourses, the pollution of the air, the laying waste
of a portion of the plant world (namely, the forests), and
the extinction of some of the animals that live with us.</p>

<p>We do not shrink from the most <i>reckless</i> exploitation
of those forests that have come down to us from the
primeval past&mdash;the vast stores of coal buried deep in the
bosom of the earth. The expert can now calculate with
certainty that in a few hundred, at the very farthest in a
thousand, years these stores will be exhausted. When it
comes to this, the triumphant progress of industrial science
will no doubt give us some substitute, perhaps even something
better; but no technical knowledge, no science, can
ever give us back anew those highly developed organisms
of the plant and animal world which man to-day is recklessly
sweeping out of the list of living things. They
cannot restore to us the green woods and their animal life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
We preserve with punctilious precision every vestige of
the art of the past. The older the documents of earlier
historic times are, the more eagerly they are coveted, the
more highly they are valued. Our collectors gladly pay
the largest sums for an old papyrus, an old picture, an
object of decorative art, or a marble statue. And, as has
been rightly remarked, what warrant have we that some
new Phidias, some new Michael Angelo, some new Praxiteles
will not arise, and give us something of as high value
as these, or even much more perfect? Unreservedly to
deny this would be the same thing as to give the lie to
the progress of the human race.</p>

<p>But the same man who, in this respect, acts so reverently,
so conservatively, looks on with folded arms while
treasures are destroyed that ought to be guarded with
special affection and care, in these times when the great
value of all natural science is so fully recognised.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>We organise, at an extremely high cost, expeditions
to survey and explore far-off regions. We sink into the
greatest depths of the sea our cunningly devised trawl-nets,
and study with ceaseless diligence the smallest
organisms that they bring up into the light of day. We
consider the course of the stars, and calculate with precision
their remote orbits. We daily discover new secrets, and
have almost ceased to feel surprised at each day bringing
us something new, something yet unheard of. Much that
is thus done to secure the treasures of the past <i>might
equally well be done in coming years. But much that we
neglect to do can never be made good</i>, for we are
permitting the slaughter, up to the point of extinction, of
the most remarkable, the most interesting, and the least
known forms among the most highly organised of the
creatures that dwell with us on our earth!</p>

<p>An example that appeals to us with terrible force is
that of South Africa (taking the country in its widest
limits), a region now so largely peopled by Europeans.
There has been an almost complete disappearance of the
larger animals that once lived in their millions on its wide
plains. If one studies the trustworthy narratives of the
earlier explorers, one reads that, hardly a century ago, it
was not a rare sight to see in one day a hundred, or even
a hundred and fifty rhinoceroses, hundreds of elephants
that showed little fear of man, and countless antelopes;
and one asks oneself, How can it be possible that all this
abundance of life has vanished in so short a time? A
specimen of the “white” rhinoceros, which in those times
was still living in large numbers, is in our day worth a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
small fortune; it is to be found <i>in no museum in Germany</i>,
and is simply almost impossible to obtain. This former
abundance is now known only to few, and these only
specialists engaged in studies of this kind. But to
them it is also plain and terribly certain that, where the
like conditions come into being, the same process that
was at work in South Africa will produce the same
results.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt about it. In a hundred years
from now wide regions of what once was Darkest Africa
will have been more or less civilised, and all that delightful
animal world, which to-day still lives its life there, will
have succumbed to the might of civilised man. That will
be the time when the fortunate possessors of horns and
hides of extinct African antelopes, and the owners of
elephant tusks, skulls, and specimens of all kinds will be
selling all this for its weight in gold. And no one will
be able to understand how it was that in our day so little
thought was given to preserving as far as possible all
this valuable material in abundant quantities at least for
<i>the sake of science</i>, instead of sacrificing it wholesale to the
interests of trade, and to the recklessness of the new
settlers in those lands. For these men, who have to
struggle hard with the new conditions of life and its
necessities, can scarcely act otherwise than heedlessly and
short-sightedly. They will always take possession of a
district before settled conditions are introduced, and before
the Government is in a position to enforce the observance
of its regulations, however well-intentioned these may be.
So it will come to pass that it will suddenly be found no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
longer possible to provide European collections with even
a pair of specimens of the mighty elephant, or to procure
other large animals for exhibition in these establishments.
And this will be the case not only with regard to the
larger species, but the same thing will happen to all others.</p>

<p>The Queen of England has lately expressed the wish
that no lady shall come into her presence wearing osprey
plumes in her hat. This act of hers should be most
heartily welcomed, for the bird world is being destroyed
in a way of which only a few experts have any idea. If
our ladies only knew that whole species of birds have
become extinct, thanks to the fashion of wearing hats
trimmed with birds’ feathers, doubtless they would no
longer pay allegiance to this destructive fashion. The
massacre of birds is carried on in some such way as this.
The leading firms agree to make this or that bird
fashionable. It is thus that the death-sentence of many
rare species of birds is pronounced. The traders scattered
all over the world give the hunters who engage in this
kind of business directions, for instance, to bring in osprey
feathers. And how are they obtained? The royal heron,
a timid and beautiful bird, is not easy to stalk. But the
businesslike hunter knows what to do. He simply kills
the herons in thousands and thousands <i>at their nesting-places</i>.
Love for its offspring brings the beautiful creature
within range of the gun-barrel of the lurking hunter, who
kills thousands of the birds in cold blood when they are
gathered together in the breeding season. Countless
thousands must be killed, countless thousands more of
young helpless nestlings, bereft of the parent birds, must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
starve to death before enough of these little plumes has
been collected to make a load heavy enough to be put on
the bearers’ shoulders. And now the dealers of the whole
civilised world lay in a stock, so that full provision may
be made for a form of fashion-mania that may probably
last only a few months. Even in the farthest swamps of
America, in the lands beyond the Caspian, and wherever
the royal heron breeds, one can follow the bird hunter, and
see him at his horrible and murderous work. The end
is everlasting silence. A rare species is soon utterly
destroyed. In the last century alone about two dozen
species of birds became extinct. And in these days nearly
a dozen more species of birds are threatened with extinction!
According to the Reports of the Smithsonian
Institute this is notably the case in America with regard
to quite as many species. The wonderful birds of paradise
are going; the latest “trimming” for the hats of American
ladies, these dwellers in remote islands of the Southern
Seas are to be threatened in a more serious degree, and
probably to a great extent exterminated. Everywhere
we have the same lamentable facts! It is certainly high
time to interfere effectively. I myself think that the best
results would follow from appeal to all noble-minded
women.</p>

<p>In Africa I have already observed an example of the
disappearance of one species of bird<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>&mdash;every European
takes a lot of trouble to get possession of some of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
much-prized marabou feathers. Now, as long ago as the
year 1900, at London, as a member of the International
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Conference for the Protection of Wild Animals, I did my
best to obtain, at least on paper, some measure of protection
for the marabou. This bird had not only quite won my
heart by its extraordinary sagacity, but for the same reason
it was a general favourite even in the times of classical
antiquity. My efforts were in vain. And this will mean
nothing more or less than the extermination of a large and
handsome bird, which is comparatively easy to hunt down,
and the rate of increase of which is exceptionally small.</p>

<p>From all these points of view the support of the
“League for the Protection of Bird Life in Germany” is to
be warmly recommended. In England these reasons have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
brought about the formation of the “Society for the
Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire,” which
devotes itself to the protection of animal life in general
throughout the world-wide British dominions.</p>

SOUTH AFRICAN LION, A CONTRAST TO THE ALL BUT MANELESS LIONS OF EAST AFRICA.</small></p></div>

<p>Let us now follow a little more closely, under the
guidance of English writers, the process of the extermination
of the South African animal world. This lamentable
work was completed very rapidly in the course of only
something like a hundred years. From numerous English
authorities, as well as from the publications of the Society
already named, I have been able to ascertain that the last
“blaauwbok” was killed by the Boers in Cape Colony
about the year 1800. From extant sketches of this wild
animal, it appears that it was a smaller species of the
splendid horse-antelopes still to be found in other parts of
Africa. During the following seventy-five years the extermination
of several other kinds of animals was systematically
carried out; and exactly eighty years later the last
quagga, a kind of zebra (<i>Equus quagga</i>) was killed by the
Boers. In England there is only one single specimen
preserved, and that in a very poor condition. It is to be
found in the British Museum. A further sacrifice to the
advancing Europeans was the giant, wide-mouthed, “white”
rhinoceros (<i>Rhinoceros simus</i>, Burch.), a mighty creature,
that formerly ranged in thousands over the grassy plains
of South Africa. The length of a horn taken from one of
them is given as 6 ft. 9 in., English measurement! Even
as late as the year 1884, a single trader was able to
pile up huge masses, small hills, of these rhinoceros horns
by equipping some four hundred tribesmen of the Matabele
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
race with guns and ammunition and sending them out
rhinoceros-hunting. Now it is difficult to get even a few
specimens of this animal for the museums, and they are
almost worth their weight in gold. Information lately
obtained seems to indicate that a very small number
of these mighty beasts, probably not more than thirty-five
in all, are still living their life in the midst of inaccessible
swamps in Zululand and Mashonaland, in a district that, on
account of its deadly climate, is almost closed to Europeans.
However, the Government of Natal has, I am pleased
to say, made the killing any animal of this species, without
legal permission, a crime to be punished by a fine of &pound;300.</p>

<p>An English officer, Captain (afterwards Sir) William
Cornwallis Harris, is an authoritative witness as to the
extermination of wild animals in South Africa in 1836,
though it must have been going on for a long time before
that without any written record. The Boers must have
slaughtered hecatombs of wild animals, though up to that
date we have no first-hand written evidence on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
Their proceedings were precisely of the same character
as the events that have occurred in our own day in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
connection with the destruction of the elephant, the
rhinoceros, and other animals throughout Africa. This
destruction goes on silently, and only a few men who have
a special knowledge of the circumstances bring some
information about it to the world at large. The rest keep
silence, and mostly have good grounds for so doing.</p>

<p>The descriptions given by Harris, Oswell, Vardon,
C. J. Anderson and their contemporaries give some idea
of what enormous multitudes of wild creatures then wandered
over the plains of South Africa. We are inclined
to underestimate the abundance of the fauna of earlier
epochs. The process of animal-destruction by the hand
of man has been going on from immemorial times. For
thousands of years man has been continually pressing the
animal world back more and more, and it has had to give
way in the unequal struggle. This process has been going
on so slowly and so imperceptibly that it is only by the
scanty remnants left from earlier times that we can form
some estimate of the wealth that has disappeared. These
are no empty fancies. All the lonely far-off islands of
the world’s seas, the little visited Polar lands, and all the
uninhabited steppes and wildernesses give us evidence of
this. Not only from the lips of Cornwallis Harris, but
also from some of his contemporaries, we have descriptions
of the former abundance of wild life in the Cape districts of
South Africa. At that time the country was, in the literal
sense of the word, covered with countless herds of Cape
buffaloes, white-tailed gnus, blessbock, bontebock, zebras,
quaggas, hill-zebras, hartebeests, eland-antelopes, horse-antelopes,
oryx-antelopes, waterbuck, impallah-antelopes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
springbocks, and ostriches. Herds of hundreds of
elephants were to be seen. Every marsh, every river-bed,
was literally overcrowded with hippopotami. All other
kinds of animals that are now so scarce, such as the large
and handsome kudu, and all the different kinds of small
wild animals, were to be met with in vast numbers.
Although since the year 1652 South Africa had been
to a continually increasing extent occupied by the Boers,
all these wonderful things had managed to survive in rich
profusion up to the moment when, about a hundred years
ago, the great war of extermination began. Various
causes contributed to bring this about: the increasing
numbers of the settlers, their continual penetration farther
and farther into the interior, and, above all things, the
improvement of firearms.</p>

<p>The natives, although very numerous in South Africa,
had, as happens everywhere, left the animal life of the
country in its abundance to the Europeans, who were
overrunning the land in increasing numbers. It was
reserved for these to bring the war of extermination to
an end in a short time. Truly a melancholy spectacle!</p>

<p>Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche describes all this in fitting words:<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
“In Africa,” he says, “a wonderful drama is to-day unfolding
itself before our eyes. It is the downfall of the
whole of a mighty animal world. What is being destroyed
is the main remnant of the great mammalian development
of the Tertiary period. Once it spread in the same fulness
over Europe, Asia, and North America. Now in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
last refuge this most wonderful wave of life is rapidly
ebbing away. Everything contributes to this result&mdash;human
progress, human folly, and even disease among the
animals themselves.”</p>

IN THE CAPE DISTRICTS SIXTY YEARS AGO. THIS EXPLORER’S SKETCHES GIVE A TRUE PICTURE OF THE LANDSCAPE
AS WELL AS OF THE ANIMALS.</small></p></div>

<p>To give an example: Through the trifling fact that
we have ivory balls for billiards, the African elephant
goes to destruction. The individual cannot stop this;
but what he can do is to secure more material for each
special branch of science before the door is closed, and
to once more observe in their primeval surroundings the
last elephants, wild buffaloes, giraffes&mdash;those last living
vestiges of the Tertiary period.</p>

<p>But above all, the sketches of Le Vaillant, a French
explorer, who, about 1780, set out from Cape Town on
his travels into the interior, are of great importance for
our study of the former abundance of animal life in South
Africa. They are all the more interesting for German
readers because he traversed part of what is now
German South-West Africa, and gives in his book an
account of its condition at that time. He, too, tells of
absolutely incredibly great multitudes of wild animals; on
the banks of the Orange River he comes upon great herds
of elephants and giraffes, and he cannot find enough to
say of the astonishing wealth of animal life. For those
who know German South-West Africa, his narrative is
of special interest. He formed collections which
he brought back with him to his native country, and to
all appearance is a fairly trustworthy authority, though
at the same time, like many contemporary and later
travellers, here and there he makes assertions that are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
clearly unwarrantable. For instance, in one place he
tells how he once rode a zebra, that he had wounded,
for a considerable distance, back to his camp.</p>

<p>Some fifty years later, at the period of the journeys
of Captain William Cornwallis Harris,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> as I have already
remarked, the same conditions prevailed, with regard to
the abundance of wild animals, as in the days of Le
Vaillant. It was almost a daily experience for the traveller
to be molested by lions. The Vaal River then teemed
with hippopotami. What is now the site of Pretoria
was inhabited by a number of rhinoceroses, that were
absolutely an annoyance to the explorer: “Out of every
bush peeped the horrible head of one of these creatures.”
Of the neighbourhood of Mafeking he tells us that the
gatherings of zebras and white-tailed gnus literally covered
the whole plain; that with his own eyes he had at one
time seen at least fifteen thousand head of wild animals!
In another place he tells us of an absolutely overwhelming
spectacle. He saw at the same time more than three
hundred elephants; to use his own expression, the plain
looked like one undulating mass.</p>

<p>William Cotton Oswell, whom I have mentioned in
my earlier work, and who died as lately as 1893, knew
the countries of South Africa in the days of Livingstone,
and gives the same account of them as his predecessor
Harris. He once came upon more than four hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
elephants gathered together in one herd on the open
velt. Unfortunately, like so many others, he published
very few sketches.</p>

<p>Gordon Cumming, a traveller well known to the
German public through Brehms’ <i>Tierleben</i>, has also left
us sketches of those days that corroborate the descriptions
given by his contemporaries. He tells how, in the
year 1860, a great drive was organised in the Orange
Free State in honour of the Duke of Edinburgh, afterwards
Grand Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The number
of wild animals driven together by the natives, which
included zebras, quaggas, gnus, cow-antelopes, blessbock,
springbocks, and ostriches, was estimated at five-and-twenty
thousand. The number killed on this one day was
reckoned at about six thousand animals, and a number
of natives were trampled to death by the herds of wild
beasts.</p>

<p>At this time there were still Europeans in South Africa
who made elephant-hunting their ordinary business. Now
there are neither elephants nor indeed any other kind of
wild animal in numbers worth mentioning in these once
rich hunting grounds. They have all been killed off in
the course of a hundred years. Where once hundreds
of thousands of gnus lived their life, there are now only
a few hundred specimens carefully preserved and guarded.
And the same is the case with all other wild animals.
Many species are gone completely and for ever. <i>A similar
process will go on slowly but surely throughout the whole
of Africa, wherever civilisation penetrates. There is only
one chance of the beautiful wild life of Africa being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
permanently preserved, and that lies in the hunters themselves
consenting to protect and spare it.</i></p>

<p>It has been rightly remarked by such a competent
authority as A. H. Neumann (who is, moreover, one of
the most experienced of English elephant hunters) that
the continued existence of many wild African species is
not incompatible with the progress of civilisation. He
points out that we can only reckon with some degree of
certainty on the effective preservation of wild animals,
where not only reservations have been established for
them, but where also a considerable amount of control
can be exercised over both Europeans and natives. In
his opinion, for instance, a mere regulation forbidding the
shooting of female elephants is impracticable: “I should
like,” he says, “to see one of those who have drawn up
such a regulation come into the African bush, and there
show us how we are to distinguish between female and
bull elephants in these impenetrable thickets.”</p>

<p>In the British colonies in Africa reservations for wild
animals have been established with most successful
results. Those of British East Africa, the Sudan and
Somaliland, and finally of British Central Africa, taken
together, have about five times the area of the Victoria
Nyanza.</p>

<p>By means of reports made as carefully as possible
by the district authorities, estimates have been obtained
of the numbers of existing wild animals. In the laying
out of the reservations the very migratory habits of the
African fauna have been taken into consideration as far
as is practicable, and by strict protective regulations of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
various kinds most satisfactory results have been secured.
In the Transvaal Colony, too, a reservation has been
marked out in the Barberton district between the Olifant
River and the Portuguese frontier. Any one shooting
in this reservation without a permit is liable to a fine of
&pound;100, or six months’ imprisonment. There is a very
interesting official report as to the wild inhabitants of this
reservation. “It contains one old rhinoceros (with shot-marks
on its hide), a small herd of elephants, a considerable
supply of ostriches, from five to nine giraffes, a satisfactory
quantity of gnus, and also of ‘black-heeled’ or impallah-antelopes,
two or three small herds of buffaloes, several
herds of zebras, numerous waterbuck and kudus, and a
small number of horse-antelopes. On the other hand,
whether oryx-antelopes and eland are still to be found
there appears to the author of the report in the highest
degree doubtful.”</p>

<p>However, in the extensive reservations that have been
established in other British possessions in Africa, and
especially in those of the Sudan, a large number of the
beautifully formed dwellers of the wilderness still live
their life, and this must be a delight to the heart of
every sportsman.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that through thus establishing
“sanctuaries” (as the English call them), with the consequent
supervision, a means has been found of protecting
the indigenous wild life of Africa, as well of America,
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>In German colonies, too, efforts are being made to
preserve, as far as possible, the native fauna. The more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
our views can be made clear, the more complete the
survey of this difficult subject can be made by the combined
experience of many experts being gradually brought to
bear together upon it, the sooner may we anticipate
satisfactory results from this co-operative action. For
years I have been following with close interest everything
connected with this question, and my wide correspondence
with officers, officials, and private individuals warrants me
in concluding that on all sides there is an energetic
movement in progress. Of course, we have to face
serious difficulties in such a campaign. Thus it seems,
according to numerous and trustworthy reports, that the
attempt to establish Boer settlements in the Kilimanjaro
district in East Africa has had, and still is having, very
fatal results for the once splendid wild life of that region.
And, indeed, it is no easy matter to reconcile a colony
of Boers&mdash;the people who have already made such a
clean sweep of the wild life of South Africa&mdash;to the
preservation of the fauna of the country. One can see
how difficult the regulation of these matters is for the
authorities.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>We must not forget also that, as a result of the
wonderful improvements in firearms, the problem of the
protection of wild animals presents itself to-day in quite
a different fashion from that of the days of the hunters
of fifty, or even of twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>But it is not the individual hunter whose interest lies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
in sport or science<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>; it is not the man who brings us
the first knowledge of many of the inhabitants of the
wilderness, and first arouses our interest in them; it is
not such as these who should be regarded as the destroyers
of the fauna of a foreign land. Rather this is the work
of all those powerful influences that everywhere combine
to this end during the introduction of civilised life. It
has indeed been already proposed, in all seriousness, by
some men of science to completely extirpate the wild
animals of East Africa, in order thus to circumvent the
tsetse fly and other minor pests that may perhaps communicate
disease from the wild to the tame cattle. And
this, too, before it can be said with any certainty whether
these cases of infection do not arise only from a number
of very small animals which it would be impossible to
exterminate!</p>

<p>Our most important task is now to obtain an accurate
knowledge of the fauna of foreign lands. For this purpose
we must collect materials which will render the study of
this wild life of other lands possible to our scientific
institutions; which will place them in a position to give
to a wide public an idea of all these rich treasures, and
thus awaken an intelligent love for them in the hearts
of the pioneers of civilisation.</p>

<p>And then we must devise practicable measures of
protection. This is a wide field of labour. The hunter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
himself must take in hand the intelligent preservation of
the wild animals. The measures of protection must be
suited to the varying conditions of the wide hunting
grounds of foreign lands, and must not be considered
only from the stay-at-home point of view.</p>

<p>This is not to be done by mere laments over the
extermination of wild life, or even by merely putting
limitations on the enjoyment of the chase by the individual
hunter. On the contrary, a beneficial result can be
obtained only by all European travellers in those countries
interchanging their experiences, collecting material, and
exerting themselves to the utmost and in concert to devise
measures that will, as far as may be, put a stop to the
threatened extermination.</p>

<p>This is a great and noble task.

The Survivors</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">To</span> learn to know anything with precision, to devote
oneself to it and master it in its smallest details, one
must generally make its study a labour of love. So the spread
of more exact knowledge of the manifestations of nature
around us must go hand in hand with the awakening of
love for them and for the splendours they present to our
view. And with this increasing impulse towards research
and knowledge must come the desire to prevent as far as
possible the rapid destruction of fauna and flora. Public
opinion, in truth, has begun to range itself on the side
of these much menaced glories of nature.</p>

<p>We have to observe and investigate. We have to get
together some small portion of the vast material that is
often so uselessly squandered, in order to employ it in the
service of special branches of science, and to make some
closer knowledge of these things accessible to every one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
We have to establish great collections formed on a definite
plan, and everywhere to save as much material as possible
for scientific and educational purposes, so long as it can still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
be done. “If these ideas could be brought home to the
right quarters, millions would be made available for this
object,” writes one of the most learned specialists in these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
matters. Our zoological gardens and museums are already
doing their best, but they are hampered by the want of
pecuniary resources. Whilst the largest sums are freely
provided for the purchase of antiquities, there is a dearth
of means for doing what is necessary to save the treasures
of our vanishing fauna while there is still time!</p>

DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAMMALIA OF GERMAN EAST AFRICA.</small></p></div>

<p>Other countries, America for instance, set us a glorious
example. There you see public collections formed, affording
panoramas of animal life so splendid, so beautiful, and
planned on such grand lines, that the love of nature must
be lighted up in the hearts of all who visit them.</p>

<p>What can be saved of these disappearing treasures must
suffice for all time, and must in part at least be preserved
in fire and thief-proof “zoological treasuries,” for it will be
impossible to obtain such things again in the future, no
matter what efforts may be made. Thus a great and
difficult task presents itself to our museums. We can
rightly require of them that they shall not merely exhibit
the principal species of the animal world, but that they
shall also preserve specimens of the most striking representatives
of our still surviving fauna that are likely soon
to become extinct. And these specimens must be guarded
by all the resources of art and science against light and
any other influence that might injure them. For such a
far-seeing policy posterity will be grateful to us.</p>

<p>It seems, however, as though some unlucky star presided
over the collecting of the larger species of the animal world.
Let any one devote himself to these special pursuits and
objects, and even if he win thereby the approval of experts
and of wide circles of the public, still a certain odium will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
seem to attach to him. Obviously he must kill a certain
number of animals, that are often <i>quite unknown</i> till then,
and in almost every case have been <i>hardly studied</i> at all,
in order that he may add them to the collections belonging
to his native country. He gains the gratitude of science
and of the learned, but he has to encounter the prejudices
of others. People think that they are justified in throwing
upon him, the scientific collector, the reproach of being an
exterminator.</p>

FOR EACH SEPARATE REGION.</small></p>

<p class="caption">I have to thank Professor Matschie for the two lower illustrations.</p></div>

<p>Those who speak thus completely forget that it was
through the material thus placed before their eyes that
they themselves obtained their very first knowledge of
these beautiful creatures; that till then they hardly
took any interest in such things; and that it is only by
means of knowledge secured in this way that regulations
for the preservation of these beauties of nature can be
devised.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that every museum and scientific
collection in the world were provided with a series of
specimens of all the varieties of the animal world that are
now most seriously threatened with extinction; let us
further suppose that each of these institutions secured,
besides, duplicate series of the hides and skeletons of each
species. To make a striking comparison, all this, beside
the wholesale destruction of the animal world of which we
have to complain, would be like a week-end sportsman
perhaps killing one hare during his whole life compared to
the millions of hares killed every year in Germany.</p>

<p>If a species is already reduced to such a state that the
taking of a few hundred, or even a few thousand, specimens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
for scientific purposes will exterminate it, we may say
generally that, even without this proceeding, it is inevitably
doomed to extinction. But the wretched egg-collecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
by youths, for instance, is quite a different matter.
Certainly there must be a great deficiency, when continually,
year after year, wood and meadow are searched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
for birds’ nests by thousands of boys. This is obvious,
and thus the rarer species are threatened in their very
existence.</p>

<p>I think that I have earned a special right to speak on
this matter. For the last fifteen years I have hardly ever
carried a gun when at home in Europe; I have refused
the most pressing invitations to shooting parties; and I
have sought pleasure only in the sight of our native wild
animals, which I know so well, and in secretly watching
and observing them. But in the midst of a yet unstudied
foreign fauna, of which we still know little or nothing,
where there is question of first obtaining some scanty
knowledge oneself, and forming collections for definite
scientific research&mdash;in the midst of an animal world of this
kind I would not hesitate to shoot even large numbers of each
species. For there would be good reason for not merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
securing well-developed male specimens, as the hunter does,
but also females and young animals in all the various stages
of growth and colouring. This must be obvious even to
a child, and no one will deny to science the right so to act,
at least in those regions of Africa which&mdash;in comparison
with India and other countries&mdash;are still untouched by civilisation,
and which therefore, in their primitive unchanged
condition, afford us doubly interesting results. Now supposing
one has got together large collections, and has been
so fortunate as to succeed in bringing them down to the
coast and home to Europe. A collection of insects or of
the lower animals may pass without remark; but woe to
the slayer of the larger species of wild animals! These
come under the description of “beasts of the chase,” and
now a peculiar kind of bacillus quickly develops&mdash;the
bacillus of “hostility to the hunter,” which, introduced into
Europe from the tropics, finds here, too, a fostering soil.
Let me be allowed to endeavour to find a prophylactic
against this bacillus in these essays. I have already often
laid stress upon the facts that such great quantities of the
skins and feathers of birds are exported for the purposes
of fashion, that by this trade whole species are threatened
with extinction; that every individual European is allowed,
without any hindrance, to send home his trophies of the
chase&mdash;trophies which, with only a few exceptions, can
have hardly any value for science; above all, that the
extermination of the elephant in Africa is being carried out
before our very eyes for the sake of his ivory; and that all
this is held permissible. But let one make collections for
scientific purposes, and scrupulously hand over every skin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
every hide, with the horns and skull belonging to it, all
carefully labelled, to some museum at home, and, according
to widely expressed opinion, he is greatly to blame for the
destruction of animal life.</p>

<p>Happily in recent years our colonial collections have
been considerably augmented. An extraordinarily large
quantity of material has been forwarded to the Berlin
Natural History Museum, amongst others, by officials,
private individuals, and members of the garrisons abroad.
Hence valuable results have been obtained for the zoology
of these regions. Amongst the satisfactory results of the
ever increasing activity in the zoological exploration of the
Dark Continent are surprising and repeated discoveries of
unknown species of animals, such as the Okapi (<i>Ocapia
johnstoni</i>) and a black wild hog, till now completely
unknown (<i>Hylochœrus meinertzhageni</i>, Oldf. Thomas).
With the help of these collections, Professor Matschie,
dealing with the mammalia, and Professor Reichenow with
the birds, have succeeded in establishing the fact that
each separate region of the Dark Continent possesses its
own characteristic fauna. And most important conclusions
with regard to the distribution of animals have thus been
derived from these great systematic collections. My friend
Baron Carlo Erlanger, the well-known African traveller,
and the only one who has ever traversed Somaliland from
end to end, though unhappily cut off by an early death,
was able to confirm these theories, with reference to the
countries he explored, by the ample collections he systematically
formed. The whole science of zoology in relation
to geography has been turned on to new lines of research,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
and has given the most important and most valuable results.
Everything should be done to support efforts of this kind.</p>

<p>But in this department it is to all increasing extent the
duty of our German museums to promote a knowledge of
and an interest in the animal world of far-off lands by the
display of ample collections, so arranged as to convey
instruction. There has already been gratifying progress
in this respect, but it is clear that for the development of
these ideas we need more extensive, up-to-date buildings
for our collections and museums. Other countries, especially
England, and above all America, are far in advance of us
in this matter. Our zoological gardens have the task of
putting the <i>living</i> animal world before us. Happily we are
doing this by far-sighted methods. To the Zoological
Gardens of Berlin belongs the credit of having, to a continually
increasing extent, arranged a display of the animal
world in appropriate surroundings, and with reference to
systematic classification and to its relations with geographical
distribution and ethnological science, so far as one can
assume the connection or companionship of certain species
with man. There we see the disappearing species of wild
cattle housed, each according to its peculiar character, in
enclosures that are strictly true to nature, and artistically
designed. Thus, for instance, the American bison&mdash;now
hardly to be obtained for its weight in gold is shown in
surroundings that remind us of the North American
Indians, these also a disappearing race. The ostrich-house
takes us back to the land of the Pharaohs, of which the
ostrich was once a characteristic inhabitant, as well as the
ichneumon, the crocodile, and the hippopotamus. Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
the class of rodents is brought before us in almost poetical
surroundings, that seem quite to justify the German animal
stories of the Middle Ages, and that are calculated to produce
quite a different effect on the mind from that of a
stiffly arranged exhibition of the regulation type, especially
in the case of the rising generation. But on account of the
difficulty of securing and maintaining certain species, and
their shortness of life in close captivity, our zoological
gardens can only properly carry out their programme so
long as it is possible for them to continually renew their
stock of animals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the museums are all the more
responsible for setting before our eyes the various species
of animals even long after these have become extinct, and
they must do this by means of works of art executed by the
hand of man, masterpieces of taxidermy.</p>

<p>And by masterpieces of taxidermy I mean artistic
groups of “stuffed” animals that will, as far as may
be, show us their life and action, their ways and habits.
In former times this work was left to the so-called “animal-stuffer.”
He took a hide, filled it out with some material
or other, and then, so far as he could, gave it the appearance
of a quadruped or a bird. Thus one sees a stuffed
hippopotamus of this good old time which looks, not like
such an animal, but like a gigantic sausage. One sees
stags or antelopes that somewhat resemble the wooden toys
associated with the Christmas boxes of my childhood, and
not the particular species of animals which they are intended
to represent&mdash;in short, wretched caricatures with neither
beauty nor fidelity to nature.

<p>Nowadays, however, more than this must be done&mdash;the
best must be insisted on. Instead of the “stuffer,” the
artist must come upon the scene. Using the methods of
the sculptor, he can artistically fashion a form that will be
true to life, and clothe this form with the hide or skin.
Happily by these means we now find such works of art
exhibited in ever increasing numbers, not only in museums
abroad, but also in the public collections of our own country.
But as yet this new department of artistic activity is not
generally as well understood as it should be. It is still far
too little valued.</p>

<p>What labour has to be devoted to the artistically correct
setting up of even one single large mammal in a museum&mdash;for
instance, a giraffe! First the animal must be hunted
down in the wilderness, and its hide carefully prepared.
Then, if it has been brought home in good condition, there
follows a second laborious preparation, and finally the setting
up. The difficult building up of the framework, and the
work upon the giant beast till all is complete, require the
labour of nearly a year. The very first conditions for the
success of the whole are great patience, knowledge, and an
ideal that is both artistic and true to nature.</p>

<p>Our illustrations show, in its various stages, the progress
of the setting up of one of the giraffes I collected in Africa.
It is easy to understand that besides artistic and scientific
ability for the correct moulding of the form, various complex
manipulations are required before the giant beast again
stands before us as if “reawakened to life.”</p>

<p>I have further tried to show by illustrations of another
giraffe, and of a series of antelopes, down to the tiny dwarf
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
antelope, how under the hand of the artist the animal world
can be made to rise up again, as if waked anew to life.</p>

<p>All our larger museums ought to exhibit the most important
and most prominent representatives of the animal
kingdom modelled in attractive groups in their natural
surroundings.</p>

<p>In America it has become the custom for private individuals
to place at the disposal of the zoological institutions
extensive collections and large sums of money. With
this help they are able to produce artistic work, true to
nature, works of art, the consideration of which gives the
spectator an insight into the life and habits of the animal
world of his native land as well as of foreign countries.
Unfortunately this custom has hardly yet been introduced
amongst us.</p>

<p>My native city of Frankfurt<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> can claim the honour of
possessing, in the time-honoured Senckenberg Institute
(now transferred to a new home), a museum founded by
private effort and private interests, where one may see
collections formed for exhibition, that may be pointed out
as models of their kind.</p>

<p>The collector of such things can partake of no greater
pleasure than he experiences when, making a tour of the
museums of various places at home, he sees awakened to
new life the wild creatures he formerly observed and laid
low in far-off lands. So I could not deny myself the
pleasure of adding to this book a number of pictures of
animals and groups of animals which I secured in the

wastes of Africa, and which are now set up in various
museums. These are trophies that must allure every
sportsman. It is of course not so easy a matter to secure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
them as it is to hack off without any trouble the antlers

<p>Paintings, true to life, from the hands of artists, photographs
taken directly from life, and finally these groups
<i>awakened, as it were, to a new life</i>, are the means that can,
and should, exert an educating and informing influence, so
that all the beauty of this department of created nature may
not be accessible only to a few learned men, but be open to
all in general. If to an ever increasing degree this object
finds support in influential circles, we shall thus obtain
what must be somehow obtained. In the presence of the
progress of industry and civilisation no one can indeed
permanently prevent by protective measures the disappearance
of certain species, even though we may hope to still
delay the process of extinction by suitable regulations. But
on this ground the duty that I have already indicated
becomes more clearly imperative upon us. Its fulfilment
cannot fail to be rewarded, in the case of all who take part
in it, by the only true satisfaction that is given to mortals,
the feeling of having done all that was in any way in our
power to do.

Sport and Nature in Germany</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Not</span> by far-away Lake Nakuro alone has “the Spell
of the Elelescho” lived. It has lived, and still lives,
all over the world; only that it goes by other names, and
is linked with other symbols.</p>

<p>In the brief summer of the Polar regions, battling
with the snow and ice and the long night, it lives
in the few stunted willows and the scanty reindeer-moss.
It can only be fully understood where the ungainly walrus,
the mighty Polar bear, coloured like his own snowfields,
and the herds of fur-adorned musk oxen and reindeer give
life to the wilderness, and millions of sea-birds cover the
cliffs, or wheel shrieking through the air. To all these
creatures the appearance of man in these wide regions is so
strange and unaccustomed that they show no fear of him,
and even come hurrying up from all sides to look curiously
at this strange new being.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>In the high mountain regions of Central Asia, too, this
spell survives, associated with the flocks of those timid
creatures the primitive wild sheep, with the graceful wild
goats, with the stately ibex,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and with the life and movement
of the countless huge bears of the mountains, and
with a strange flora that I myself have never looked upon,
but of whose existence I am as persuaded as of that of the
spell itself.</p>

<p>It is to be found in the jungles of India, whence the
tolerant natives have never driven it out. They have not
expelled the animal world from its paradise. There in
the region of the lotus-flower the spell may perhaps be
recognised on still, moonlit nights.</p>

<p>It survives everywhere: in the Australian bush, in
the New and the Old World, on all islands, in all rivers
and waters, in the life and movement of the waves and
depths of the ocean, so full of secrets everywhere; in
a word, where man has not yet driven it away.</p>

<p>Once it lived everywhere in Germany, and even to-day
it is still to be found in many places. It has its being
where the mighty elk made its home on moor and marsh-land,
and our forefathers hunted the aurochs and the bison
in the primitive forest. To-day it is associated with the
edelweiss and the chamois in the Alps; it has its being
in the oak and beech woods, and where the green current
of the Rhine flows down, or where the stag sends afar his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
cry of challenge to his rival, and the huntsman makes
his way over the moor.</p>

<p>There one still experiences the spell of the Elelescho.
But everywhere, all over the world, everywhere in our
Fatherland, it once lived and held sway.</p>

<p>We may hope that the intimate and beautiful relations
that the German sportsman establishes between himself
and nature in his Fatherland will for a long, long time
be handed down from generation to generation, and thus
result in the maintenance and preservation of the noble old
spell of the woodland and the wilderness. The ideal of
<i>true German sportsmanship</i> has been developed in as high
and full a sense as that of <i>fair play in sport</i> in England.</p>

<p>Both of these ideals will be judged in unfriendly fashion
only by those who regard them from a distorted point
of view. The English ideal of sport is winning the world
to itself; the German ideal must do the same.</p>

<p>Coming from a good German school of sport, I consider
myself fortunate in having learned to know the wonderful
animal world of Africa. There is no doubt whatever that
I must ascribe to the influence of this school the fact that
my accounts of what I had experienced and seen met with
such an appreciative reception both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>How wonderful is the chase in Germany! The
primitive attraction for the chase must be a part of every
man. One need only once have seen the excitement that
seizes upon a gathering of thousands if on a sudden a hare
or some other wild creature comes into sight. At such
a moment, almost without exception, every one of them
is on the move, without the least reflection, and even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
notwithstanding the consciousness that in no case can he
himself secure the prize. It is the call of a strong impulse
deep rooted in men. But in our Fatherland how grandly
and nobly what we mean by “true sportsmanship” has
developed out of this primitive instinct!</p>

<p>A certain kind of organisation of the business of the
chase must have been in existence even in primeval times.
Those who have made a study of this department of the
life of nomadic hunters in many lands tell us that tribes
and groups of families hunt only in well-defined areas,
and as they value their lives do not venture to pass these
boundaries. I have learned the same thing by my own
personal experience of the Wandorobo and other nomad
huntsmen of the African plateau. It must therefore have
been the case everywhere, from the times when primitive
men, the cave-dwellers, began their struggle with the mighty
beasts of primeval days, down to our own times, when the
chase is more and more regulated till at last it becomes the
exclusive property of the owner of the land.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this right came measures for game
preservation both against the interference of the stranger
sportsman, and as regards the wild creatures themselves.
Increasing knowledge taught the hunter that he could not
kill more than a certain number of wild animals without
extirpating them entirely in his district.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Hence grew up
our complex game-laws of to-day, and the general feeling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
that our hunting grounds should be used in as intelligent
a way as possible. In Germany this problem has been
solved to a remarkable extent. German sport has an
important influence on the welfare of the people. Great
numbers of our people are strengthened in body and mind
by the chase, and, thanks to it, considerable sums of money
are added to the resources of the country folk.</p>

<p>According to a moderate estimate there are now in
Germany upwards of half a million sportsmen. Each year
they kill about 40,000 head of red and fallow deer, about
200,000 roebuck, 4,000,000 hares, 4,000,000 partridges,
and 400,000 wild ducks, in all some 25,000,000 kilograms
(over 50,000,000 lb.) of wild game, of a value of
25,000,000 marks (&pound;1,250,000), and forming nearly one
per cent. of the total meat supply of Germany. The
game leases bring in about 40,000,000 marks annually
(&pound;2,000,000).<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> But these very sportsmen, who every year
kill such a large quantity of wild animals, must at the
same time be protectors and guardians of this same animal
life! Strange as it may seem, many species of wild
animals would have been long ago extinct if there were
no sportsmen. For imperative reasons, the hunter must
at the same time undertake the part of protector.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p><i>But this idea ought to be to include a great deal more than
is now the case.</i> As I have already said, no nation has
known so well how to form a beautiful and poetical ideal
of the chase and the spirit of sport as the Germans have
done. But it is not to be denied that this perfect development,
even in its very completeness, has in a certain sense
become one-sided, in so far as sportsmen restrict their
protection and guardianship to certain species of animals;
one-sided, too, inasmuch as to a certain extent they regard
their mission from the point of view of a close corporation.
In this there is a certain advantage, but also a certain
amount of danger now that, as a result of the rapid progress
of civilisation, changes are introduced in every department
of life so much more quickly than in earlier times.</p>

<p>Huntsmen and fishermen desire the complete extermination
of all kinds of animals that they consider to be a
cause of injury to their sport. The result is the destruction
of many kinds of animals that are beautiful in form and
constitute an ornament of the landscape. By the same
kind of reasoning sportsmen, in their capacity of landlords
and forest owners, ought to demand the extermination of
the wild animals that obtain their food from field and
forest. Naturally sportsmen do not want this, but they
should, as far as may be, let themselves be guided by
higher points of view. This is the case already in many
instances. For example, as an instance of zealous game
supervision inspired by scientific principles, we have lately
had to welcome a valuable idea of Forest Commissioner
Count Bernstorff. According to his plan, small labels that
will not annoy the animals (the so-called “Game marks”)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
are attached near the ears of young roebucks and red
deer. Thus their resting-places, their movements, their
growth, can be carefully observed.... We are, therefore,
actually living in a time when to a certain extent each
individual head of game is numbered!</p>

<p>Interesting and valuable as such measures may be,
should we not extend our loving care also to the animals
that, though they are not reckoned as game, yet adorn
and give animation to the land we live in? Some great
landlords have given a bright example of progress in this
direction. Thus in Hungary there are sporting estates
on which wolf and bear are not completely exterminated,
and in Germany estates on which the fox is spared to a
certain extent. The result has been to the advantage of
stags’ antlers and bucks’ horns on the estates in question.
English landlords allow a free home to a pair of peregrine
falcons or eagles, so as not to allow these beautiful birds
to be completely extirpated.</p>

<p>From these examples it is clear that there can be
various opinions as to the view generally taken with regard
to “predatory animals.” If there is not merely a selfish
protection for game animals, but also protection for the
other mammals and birds, we shall thus preserve from
extinction some of the glorious forms of the realm of
nature, and prevent their being sacrificed to narrow
interests. There is food for thought in the fact that (as I
have often had occasion to observe in Africa) in primitive
countries there is to be found an astounding abundance
of animal life. <i>Since prehistoric times man has been
engaged in hunting with his simple weapons without, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
the whole, very much diminishing the number of animals.</i>
A striking proof that the destruction of wild life is the
work of the Europeans themselves, and of the native
hunters carrying firearms under their authority, is afforded
by the fate of the North American buffalo, the whales,
walruses, and seals of the frozen seas, and finally by that
of the elephant in certain districts and of the South African
fauna taken as a whole.</p>

<p>We should not therefore act so rigorously in the
proscription of our so-called “predatory” animals. Yet,
for instance, my near neighbour, Freiherr H. Geyer von
Schweppenberg, has lately shown that our pretty water-hen
(<i>Gallinula chloropus</i>, L.) can do a great deal of damage
to grass and corn.</p>

<p>In South Africa what are called “poisoning clubs”
have been organised, which aim at the extermination of
“noxious animals” by poison. The use of poison ought
to be entirely forbidden by legal enactments, with the
exception, perhaps, of its administration for scientific
purposes. The strychnine canister&mdash;the use of which
ought only to be allowed, and that in exceptional cases,
to those who are making scientific collections&mdash;is now
making its appearance everywhere all over the world.
I have had news from the most distant countries of its
employment, unhappily with far too great success.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> It is
already some time since the last <i>Lammergeier</i> of the
German hill districts fell a victim to it. It is thinning to
frightful extent the numbers of the bears in Eastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Asia and other countries, though these are quite harmless
to man. But in our Fatherland a completely organised
“poison business” has grown up, which is a very serious
matter.</p>

<p>I should like also to advocate strongly the legal prohibition
of the use of pole-traps, to which all our owls
and birds of prey fall victims.</p>

<p>If we go on as we are going, the time cannot be far
distant when we shall have to strike out of the list of
the living several interesting members of our native
fauna. In North America, in recent times, the following
species, amongst others, have some of them become
extinct, others extremely scarce: the Californian grizzly
bear (<i>Ursus horribilis californicus</i>), the San Joaquin
Valley elk, or wapiti (<i>Cervus nannodes</i>), Stone’s reindeer
(<i>Rangifer stonei</i>), the prongbuck or pronghorn (<i>Antilocapra
americana</i>), the Pallas cormorant (<i>Phalacrocorax perspillicatus</i>),
the Labrador duck (<i>Camptolaimus labradorius</i>),
the ivory woodpecker (<i>Campephilus principalis</i>), the scotar
(<i>Aix sponsa</i>), several other species of birds, and finally
the American woodcock. This last falls a victim chiefly
to professional hunters, who are accustomed to kill it by
hundreds in its winter quarters.</p>

<p>“This list could perhaps be extended,” Mr. R.
Rathbun, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute
(whose kindness I have to thank for this information),
adds at the end of his letter.</p>

<p>His communications have also been of special interest
to me because they awoke in me old recollections. In
the ‘forties of the past century my father received a letter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
from North America in which he was informed that on
ground over which the New York of to-day extends, one
could shoot in a single day hundreds of woodcock. I
myself, in my young days, used to take care of a beautifully
coloured parrot, of a kind that since then has been almost
extirpated, and is hardly to be obtained any longer.
<i>Connurus carolinensis</i> is the name of this beautiful species
of parrot, which also appears on the list of extinct animals
of North America. There, too, men have begun to give
strong practical expression to the movement for animal
protection. In sanctuaries like Yellowstone Park there
is complete protection for all animal life, including beasts
of prey, and the bears have become so tame that they
allow visitors to come within a few paces of them.
Count E. Bernstorff, who received permission to shoot
one of the few bisons still preserved in the State of
Wyoming, says “One might take the way in which the
animal life of America is protected as an example in
securing still better preservation for the survivors of the
primeval wild life of Africa. One must acknowledge that
the Americans and their noble President, a brave sportsman,
are now doing all that is possible in this matter.”</p>

<p>President Roosevelt, in fact, has come forward manfully
in the lists as a champion of widely extended protection
for all the beauties of nature, and especially of the animal
world. He endeavours by his words and writings to
work effectually for these great and noble ideas, which
bring to all men delight, profit, and contentment.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>Brought up in the school of German sportsmanship,
I had later on to change completely my view as to our
distinction between “noxious animals” and “beasts of
prey.” The African wilderness swarms with <i>beasts of prey</i>,
and yet also swarms with <i>useful wild animals</i>. The waters
of Africa teem with the <i>fish destroyers</i>, and also teem
with <i>fish</i>. We should not therefore act so short-sightedly
and pedantically. We should not be so eager to hunt
down the last fox, the last pine-marten. The nesting-places
of herons and cormorants are becoming ever fewer;
the places where the handsome black tree storks build
in our German Fatherland can almost be counted on
the fingers of one hand; and the same is nearly true of
the nesting-places of our rarer birds of prey.</p>

<p>The killing of a wild cat has already become an event;
it is the same with the eagle-owl.</p>

<p>Out of the mass of literature of recent date bearing
on the subject, I take a single book. In a very readable
essay, <i>Der Uhu in B&ouml;hmen</i>, Kurt Loos shows that only
a few years ago this interesting and beautiful large owl
(<i>Bubo maximus</i>) was to be found making its home to
the extent of some fifty pairs in thirty-five districts of
Bohemia; now only eighteen pairs are living there, in
ten districts. The author demands protection for the
surviving pairs of owls, as natural objects that should be
preserved, and he makes out a strong case for his proposal.
R&ouml;ntgen-ray photographs are among the illustrations of
this interesting work, and they suggest that in times when
one can do one’s work with such excellent appliances,
there is all the more reason for avoiding the thoughtless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
neglect of legacies left to us by Nature from the days of
its primeval beauty.</p>

<p>Numerous other examples of the rapid disappearance
of certain species in our Fatherland might be quoted here.
Unfortunately we have, on the whole, very little right to
reproach the people of Southern Europe on the subject
of their custom of carrying on a systematic massacre
of birds; for we ourselves are always trapping thrushes
and larks, and there is the shooting of the woodcock in
spring. There can be no doubt that, if we would give
up this spring shooting of the woodcock, this bird, which
has so won the heart of the German sportsman, would
breed abundantly in our forests. On sporting estates in
the wooded hills in Baden I have had occasion to observe
this bird nesting; and it is to be regretted that German
sportsmen, who in other matters obey the customs of the
chase with such scrupulous conscientiousness, do not spare
this bird in the spring-time, although they are thus
extirpating from their hunting grounds a bird that breeds
in the woodlands of our country. The North American
woodcock is in process of extinction, for it also is not
spared by sportsmen in its breeding grounds, and it is
just as little in safety from them in its winter quarters.
It is thus one of the disappearing birds of North America,
whilst our European woodcock is not so much exposed
to harm from systematic pursuit either in its partly inaccessible
northern breeding grounds or in its winter
abode. But it is indeed difficult to abolish old, deep-rooted
practices that are no longer abreast of the times.
“Che vuole, signore?&mdash;il piacere della caccia!” was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
reply of an Italian to a tourist who remonstrated with
him on the subject of the extraordinarily widespread
destruction of doves by means of nets in Northern Italy.
The same answer would probably be given by the monks<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
of certain islands of the Mediterranean, who, keeping up
an old custom, kill countless multitudes of turtle-doves
during their migration. These are their favourite dainties,
and they also export them largely in a preserved state.
So, too, it will be a difficult matter to obtain from German
sportsmen the complete abandonment of their pleasant
spring campaign against the woodcock. Through the
very interesting experiments of the Duke of Northumberland,
who had marks put upon numbers of young
woodcock, it has been ascertained that large numbers of
them undoubtedly spend the whole winter in England.
Now, if Professor Boettger and Wilhelm Schuster are
right in their conclusions, drawn from similar observations,
as to the return of the conditions of the Tertiary period,
and if the species of birds they observed used at an
earlier date not infrequently to winter with us, a more
extended protection for the woodcock ought, at any rate,
to be introduced.</p>

<p>The continual levying of contributions on our colonies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
of sea-gulls, to the injury of a great number of the
other species of birds that inhabit our sea-coasts, should
also be greatly restricted. If this is not done we shall
witness, within a period already in sight, a lamentable
extermination of our shore- and sea-birds. And how
grateful for protection many species show themselves!
Wherever it is extended to them they enliven the landscape
in the most pleasing way. So, too, it has been
found that certain species of gulls have adapted themselves
to a kind of nocturnal life in the neighbourhood of our
great commercial ports.</p>

<p>I may here mention as standing in special need of
protection, and as wonderful adornments of our German
landscape, whose preservation should find an advocate in
every thoughtful man&mdash;the buzzard, the kestrel, the hobby-hawk,
both our varieties of kite, the crane, the heron,
the white and the black stork, the crested grebe, the
water-hen, and the coot. All these enliven and embellish
the landscape to a conspicuous extent, and should not be
sacrificed to selfish interests.</p>

<p>I knew an old gamekeeper, a native of the March
of Brandenburg, who throughout the course of a long
life had been taking care of a shooting estate, which
had grown up with him, so to speak. He protected <i>his</i>
wild creatures, and was delighted at having a colony of
storks’ nests and a group of badger burrows in <i>his</i> woods.
For long years he was able to preserve a primeval oak,
the largest in the whole district, which in the year 1870
he named the “King’s Oak.”</p>

<p>To-day no birds of prey breed any longer on this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
estate; the primeval village of badgers is in ruins, and
irreverent hands have cut down the “King’s Oak.” But
the old man, now that his time of service has expired,
never sets foot on the estate, though he is passing the
evening of his life in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>That was a man who had innate in him a just and
reverent feeling for the preservation of the beauties and
glories handed down to us from the far past, and who
loved, and, so far as it was possible, guarded these
wonders of nature.</p>

<p>Let us once for all throw overboard the sharp
distinction between “noxious” and “useful” animals,
and within certain limits let us protect the whole world
of animal and plant life. This would be the noblest
form of game preservation, in the widest sense of the
word.</p>

<p>I venture to dwell upon these ideas here, knowing
that they are shared by a large number of men and
women. Amongst our German game-preserving associations
we have societies that have rendered great services
to the protection of our native wild animals. An extension
of these useful efforts to the protection of all our native
fauna and flora in general is most certainly called for by
the greatly altered conditions of our time. We are
gradually coming to a period when every individual wild
animal will be registered by specialists and indicated
in a list! And we are also gradually approaching in
our sporting estates the ideal of extensive, well-kept
gardens, in which no touch of wild nature will any longer
be left.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>I appeal once more to the authority of President
Roosevelt. He expresses the opinion that it is now not
so much the question of preserving great supplies of
any one species as of maintaining the primitive beauty
of the forest in its wild life.</p>

<p>I think with pleasure of my youth, when, at a time
when my father, in union with other game-preservers,
founded the <i>Jagdschutzverein</i> (“Association for the Protection
of Game”) of the Rhine Province, I had the
opportunity of making myself acquainted with the old
state of things in this department. My native district,
the Eifel, still sheltered boars, eagle-owls, wild cats, and
many other rare animals living in wild freedom. The
ear of the boy learned to know and to love every cry
of our native fauna. Roosevelt rightly remarks that
many of the cries of American animals, such as the hoot
of the owl, are <i>falsely</i> described as unpleasant. He who
knows them well comes to love them, and would not
like to miss them from the general concert of animal
sounds. Here in Germany, too, we have evidence of this
to a gradually increasing extent.</p>

<p>The German sportsman ought to give a shining
example to those of other lands in this matter of the
protection of <i>all</i> the dwellers in his hunting grounds.
To his care is entrusted <i>the whole German fauna</i> in its
widest extent. To secure the preservation of this splendid
work of nature here in Germany is an enterprise that
will earn the gratitude of every lover of nature, the
thanks of millions of men. The German sportsman, as
the chosen guardian and keeper of the wild life of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
native land, must also become the protecting lord of all
its animal and plant life; he should maintain his own
estate in its primitive condition to the fullest possible
extent. But to his estate, in a wider sense, also
belongs the velt of German Africa, still so rich in wild
life. Here, too, the German sportsman should take up
the position of guardian and protector.</p>

<p>The well-known English writer Clive Philips-Wolley
says that happily the old English sporting spirit is not
dead; that the farthest and wildest hunting grounds of
the world, a visit to which demands the greatest energy
and courage, are still sought out by men of the English
race, as in earlier days. England owes a great part of
her colonies to men, eager for enterprise, who as hunters
penetrated into unknown wildernesses; and the English
hunter has, thanks to his courage and determination,
always played a great part among strange peoples. The
reckless conduct of travellers in far-off countries and
among strange tribes is often sufficient to give a <i>whole
nation</i> a bad character in the eyes of these people, while
a right bearing may make it appear worthy of their
admiration. Philips-Wolley further points out that the
taking of “big bags” of game in far-off hunting grounds<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
should not be considered merely from the point of view
of stay-at-home people, but from the point of view of
those who have special knowledge of the districts in
question.</p>

<p>The time has passed when far-off lands were secured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
in this way. But I would wish for the German sportsman
that he may, so far as is possible, visit the splendid
hunting grounds that he can now find in the German
colonies, and there become familiar with the chase in
forms that our homeland can no longer offer to him.
The more brethren of the green-coated guild go abroad
nowadays, and bring us tidings of the fauna and of the
hunting grounds of the German colonies, the more will
our knowledge of this difficult subject be enlarged, and
we shall be in a better position for working out practical
protective regulations for the preservation of these splendid
hunting grounds.</p>

<p>And what a deep charm for the hunter there is in
pursuing the chase in such regions! It is true that
circumstances have so greatly changed in a few decades
of years that the old hunters&mdash;say those of fifty years
ago&mdash;would probably not be able to take the same deep
delight in the sport of to-day that they felt in their own
time. It was quite a different matter to go out to meet
the dangerous wild beasts of Africa with the simple
weapons, the muzzle-loaders, of that time. True, the
African hunters, whom Professor Fritsch made acquaintance
with in Cape Colony about the time of the ‘sixties,
already possessed long-range weapons. They used
“small-bore rifles” firing an elongated bullet that carried
up to 1,500 yards. These rifles were fitted with ivory
sights and silver sighting-lines, for shooting at night. A
hunter named Layard was at that time famous in Cape
Colony for having brought down an ostrich at 1,750
yards!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>Let us follow for once the wanderings of a hunter
in East Africa, and give ourselves up completely to the
charm of such a sporting expedition. No one is better
fitted for making himself acquainted with lands that are
remote, difficult of access and unhealthy, than the sportsman,
who, even in such tracts of country, can find
enjoyment. Besides the greater or less delight that the
chase itself affords, much besides that is beautiful and
desirable will present itself to him.</p>

<p>When he has got his caravan together he enjoys in
the first place the feeling of primitive untrammelled life
in the wilderness. We see, indeed, how amongst those
who belong to the most highly developed of civilised
nations, even in our own days, the need of some dim
reflection of this life makes itself plainly felt. Thus,
especially in America, we see how many dwellers in cities
spend some days out ill the woods and prairies, in order
to enjoy there for some time under the tent the pleasures
of camp-life.</p>

<p>In a land which, like Africa, harbours all kinds of
dangers, we must leave all hesitation behind us. In fact,
the charm of danger must be an attraction to the huntsman.
He has to justify the confidence of his followers and of
his comrades. The natives who come in contact with
him will by his bearing and conduct form their judgment
of all his compatriots, and of his native land as a whole.
So there imposes itself on him the duty of regarding
himself as <i>a representative of his nation</i>. Though
he is justified, if it comes to that, in defending his life
even by bloodshed, he will nevertheless seek, as far as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
is possible, to enter into friendly relations with the native
tribes. In many districts of Africa the European will
traverse, with altogether superior weapons in his hands,
countries whose inhabitants still fight with nearly the
same weapons that were borne by prehistoric tribes. But
notwithstanding this, he must remember that his superiority
rests chiefly on the prestige that the European possesses
in presence of the black man. But this prestige will not
suffice, especially at night, to keep off all attacks. It is
therefore necessary that proper precaution should be the
rule. This is in the long run not such an easy matter,
for generally in the midst of apparent peace no one will
think of the possibility of an attack. But it often takes
place without warning; and thefts at night will also sometimes
happen. In short, the middle course between
necessary precaution and needless nervousness is not
always easy for the traveller to hit upon.</p>

<p>But all this, to a great extent, adds to the charm of
that wild caravan life. There is something endlessly
alluring in thus going out into the open country with all
one’s belongings, pitching one’s camp by some pleasant
place where there is water, and under shady trees, and
wandering, free as the birds, wheresoever the desire or
wish of the moment leads one. Of course, if no shady
trees are to be found, if the water tastes strongly of natron,
or looks more like pea-soup than clear spring-water, if
swarms of mosquitoes annoy one in the night, and flies
and other insects in the daytime, all this must be put
up with as a part of this wild life. Free as the birds,
we can indeed choose our way, but with the everlasting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
restriction that it lies where water is to be found, and that
we can secure supplies.</p>

<p>But with a little good-humour one can get over all
this, especially if one keeps before one’s eyes the fact
that there are many worse things here, such as malaria,
dysentery, and all the other numerous tropical diseases
with which these lands are so lavishly supplied. But we
could not find greater enjoyment in the primitive beauty
and charm of this wilderness, even if all this were
not so.</p>

<p>It is true that the hunter in Equatorial Africa cannot
obtain such splendid trophies as the stag’s antlers, that
marvellous structure built up by an animal organism, and,
according to R&ouml;hrig’s striking researches, renewed again
year after year in about eighteen weeks. But instead
there beckon to him other prizes&mdash;the mighty horns of
the buffalo, the heavily knotted horns of the eland, the
strong spiral horns of the two species of kudus, the
variously shaped horns of the cow-antelopes, the sword-like
horns of the oryx-antelope, all the beautiful variously
shaped antelope and gazelle horns, and many others
that make most delightful trophies, and will be still more
highly valued the more sportsmen go to these distant
countries, and the more these treasures, often so difficult
to obtain, are understood. The mighty weapons
of the elephant, that glitter white in the sun, the
uncouth horns from the head of the rhinoceros or the
tusks of the hippopotamus, the head of a giant crocodile
bristling with teeth, the plain and yet so eagerly
coveted hide of the King of the Desert, and the glaringly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
variegated skin of the leopard&mdash;all these are souvenirs
and trophies that have the greatest charm for the hunter;
of the greatest charm and value if he himself has taken
them, and not merely (to use the sharp words with which
Roosevelt scourges such practices) contracted for their
capture. The German sportsman must contend for all
these trophies against certain unsportsmanlike elements,
such as the Boers, who unfortunately seem to be now
exterminating the wild animals on Kilimanjaro; but they
belong to the sportsman much more than to such as these.
German hunters should not hesitate to take by sportsmanlike
methods their fair share of the stock of big game,
and in this way, as has long been the case in India and
Ceylon, a code of customs of the chase will grow up in
the German colonies, suited to the special circumstances
of the country. In a publication by Captain Schlobach,
that is well worth reading, it was recently stated that the
military posts at Olgoss and Sonjo on the Masai uplands
were continually at starvation point, and, in default of
other supplies, had often recently been provisioned entirely
with the spoils of the chase.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> What would not German
sportsmen (who contribute such large sums to the colonies)
have given to be able to shoot these wild animals, and
at the same time to help to spread in our colonies the
ideals of the chase as understood in Germany, and to
assist in the general recognition and success of German
sportsmanship!</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the animal world of foreign lands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
is gradually increasing to such a satisfactory extent that not
only do we find a general interest taken in the wild life and
the hunting grounds of our colonies, but we shall also be
in a position to introduce adequate measures of protection
for this beautiful fauna.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>THE NY&Iacute;KA: A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW.</small></p></div>

<p>In our colonies much has been lately done towards
clearing up the hitherto hidden secrets of animal life. But
if one remembers how many different opinions there are,
even amongst authorities at home in Germany, with regard
to many of the questions relating to our home fauna, one
will pass a more lenient judgment on the many sharp
controversies about matters of this kind in the tropics.</p>

<p>But nothing of value is to be hoped for from controversial
strife over divergent theories. All men who
have acquired expert knowledge on these difficult matters
should rather unite in a common task, and strive by co-operation
to obtain some adequate result.</p>

<p>In the wide British colonial possessions in Africa very
extensive reservations have been established, in which no
one is allowed to harm the animals. The practice of
making exceptions in favour of certain officials has not
been found to answer, and has been given up. So now
wide districts of British Africa rank as animal sanctuaries.</p>

<p>In German Africa, too, the authorities have tried, as far
as they can, to obtain useful results by similar methods.
Unfortunately serious events of many kinds are daily
contributing to the diminution in numbers of the fauna
of German Africa. Thus the war in South-West Africa
is sweeping away the still surviving stock of wild animals
as with an iron broom.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>In the face of all this, all parties concerned should take
their share in common action. Our museums should be
provided with the necessary material. Even if our knowledge
of the African fauna has made sufficient progress, it
further concerns us to exert an educating and informing
influence on every pioneer of our colonies, so that he may
not come in contact with that beautiful animal world in
utter ignorance of it. Unfortunately we are still greatly
wanting in this respect. However, in recent years a great
amount of material has been placed at the disposal of
the museums by our colonial officers, officials, and private
individuals. Many of them have even made important
contributions to our special knowledge of the animal
world.</p>

<p>But now, whether it is a question of tracing out the
hidden and unknown life and ways of that equatorial
animal world that has come into our possession, or of
investigating the customs and languages of races that are
barely discovered, or of tracking the horrors of tropical
diseases and the germs that excite them and becoming
master of that miniature world of life with the lens and the
microscope, or of going into the wilderness as a sportsman&mdash;the
men who devote themselves to all these pursuits
will be led onwards by that spell, whose name the reader
guesses, the spell of unchanged primeval conditions and
untouched nature!</p>

<p>May as many as possible of our German sportsmen go
forth into our tropical possessions and yield themselves up
to this spell! That which in our hunting grounds at home
speaks to their hearts in the rustling of the oak and beech
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
woods and on familiar moors and fields, they will find
in a far higher degree in that far-off wilderness under the
German flag. Returning home, may they, working in
unison, and by mutually supplying what each may lack,
bring into existence some splendid memorial of the joys of
German sport.

The Lonely Wonder-world of the Ny&iacute;ka</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> endless wilderness of the Ny&iacute;ka presents to the
traveller so much that is strange, beautiful, and
wonderful that at times his senses become wearied of
these changing impressions of travel, and a longing comes
over him for the familiar scenes he has learned to love
at home.</p>

<p>As though in giant characters written on its rocks, the
Ny&iacute;ka tells us of the conditions and the life of the past
and at the same time of everyday actualities, giving us
its message as well by its snow-covered volcanic peaks
as in the footprints and tracks of the mighty creatures
that wander through it. It is a difficult undertaking to
reconstruct in fancy all the splendours that must once
have presented themselves to the eye in this region. But
nevertheless I will tell of what I have looked upon in
the past,&mdash;of the many beautiful sights that linger in my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
memory and rise up like the shadows of a mirage,&mdash;of
the delightful manifestations of its moving life, coming
and going on hill and in valley, as strange, wondrous, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
unfamiliar forms reveal themselves to the astonished
spectator.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i232" src="images/i232.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><small>A VELT HILLOCK. THE SOLITARY TREE WAS FULL OF NESTS OF
WEAVER-BIRDS.</small></p>
</div>

<p>The mystery of a deep harmonious influence belongs
to the mighty wilderness. It reveals itself in its full
beauty to him who has strenuously acquired a love for
it by making a long sojourn in it and paying to it the
tribute it demands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A stony wilderness extends endlessly on all sides, and
the sight ranges without limit over the expanse that loses
itself in mist and cloud. A barren stony sea, as far as
the eye can reach!</p>

<p>But it is not the velt or the African desert that lies
below us as we rise one moment a hundred yards above
the surface of the earth and the next three hundred
yards and more. It is the sea of houses that form the
capital of the German Empire.... In a few seconds
the view takes in all the full extent of the mighty city,
and then, as if in a dream, what we have just seen
disappears from our sight. Borne by a breeze, of which
we are hardly aware, our balloon sweeps towards the
Baltic Sea.... It is a strange feeling thus to enjoy,
thanks to our lofty point of outlook, an extended view
far over the level March of Brandenburg with its teeming
population all below us, a view which, old as the world
is, has been vouchsafed to few mortal men. The city,
with all its human life and activity, lies far below us. Its
roar and tumult, that strange voice of the stony sea, has
died away. We begin to make a long journey only a
few hundred feet above the surface of the earth. Later
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
on we rise, sailing through banks and clouds to a height
of nine thousand feet above the earth, but before this
higher ascent we have time and leisure to take a bird’s-eye
view of “all that creeps and flies.” What an outlook
over forest and plain! As we fly over them, horses
grazing in paddocks, cattle on the pastures, for a moment
suggest to me an illusion of the African velt peopled
with its wild life. The eye, again and again fascinated
by this prospect as a whole, can hardly grasp the details.
Now our course is over endless open heaths, over moors
and woodlands. The fleet-footed red deer, frightened by
the drag-rope, look up in astonishment and stare at the
strange monster, not knowing whither to turn in flight
from such a menacing apparition. How the strange
monster was a few hours later within a hair’s breadth of
burying us in the waves of the Baltic Sea is another
story....</p>

<p>How many hundred times, after I had gone back to
the Dark Continent, have I wished for such a lofty
observatory, an airship that would bear me over velt
and desert, and from which I could fathom all the secrets
of the animal world of the tropics, instead of having to
travel toilsomely, fettered to the earth, often merely
making step after step automatically in the blazing heat
of the sun. When one day such a wish as this is fulfilled,
that animal world in its beauty and splendour will have
to a great extent passed away....</p>

<p>I must, therefore, content myself with lofty observatories
of another kind, that are not unfrequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
to be found in the Masai uplands, in the form of
numerous hills and rock masses. These afford splendid
views and pictures of the animal creation to the spectator
who waits patiently on their summits for hours and
days, and has the help of good optical instruments. What
life and activity displays itself there before our eyes
under favourable circumstances! Though the wilderness
may appear a desert solitude, bare and empty of all
life, let only a few hours go by and the sun change
its position a little, and already one sees movement under
the trees and bushes that have been till now casting
deep shadows. Then with measured steps, prudently
regardful of their safety, all kinds of animals come forth
to graze. We see the different wild species appearing,
at first a few individuals, and soon in greater or smaller
herds.</p>

<p>How far the eye carries in this clear transparent
atmosphere, and what a wide tract of country we are
able to overlook! In this tropical brightness, after weeks
and months, and even years, I could not get rid of the
perplexing illusion as to distances. The tract of country
that my sight could command seemed always much
less extensive than it really was. And again, we were
continually being misled by shimmering reflections of the
air, so that we took gnus for elephants, ostriches for
rhinoceroses, zebras for wild asses, and we might even
hold to our mistaken view for a considerable time. He
who wants to watch the living animals in this way from
a lofty point of observation, must be able to keep on
persistently for hours. Thus only will the scene piece

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
by piece become familiar to him. Thus only will all
the moving life below him very gradually combine into
one splendid and intelligible picture.</p>

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>ONE OF MY LOOK-OUT PLACES ON THE PLATEAU BETWEEN KILIMANJARO AND MOUNT MERU.</small></p>
</div>

<p>On the way to my look-out hill I pass thousands of
the tracks made by wild animals.</p>

<p>At the very outset, the traveller from northern lands
sees a most surprising sight in those hundreds of thousands
of tracks made by wild animals, and faithfully preserved for
weeks and even for longer periods in the dry season on the
plains of Africa. The giants of the animal world leave
behind them their mighty footprints, often for nearly
a year, holes in which a man will sometimes break his
leg. But the footprints of the smaller animals also last
a long time on velt and plain. And the language of
the wilderness rises to a most effectual appeal to our
senses when these tracks are associated with the marked
tarry scent of the waterbuck in the bush, the breath of
the great wild herds on the plain, the strong scent left
by elephant or rhinoceros in the primeval forest and in
the sultry thickets, and the scent of the buffalo among
the reed-beds.</p>

<p>There is often a chaos of tracks, a wild maze of
paths trodden flat as a barn-floor, crossing each other,
and then again uniting, so that the idea of tame herds,
mentioned before as at times suggested, can no longer
hold good.</p>

<p>To-day we have again waited patiently to see the
wilderness gradually come to life in the hours of the
afternoon. And we have not been disappointed.</p>

<p>Out from the shadows of scattered groups of trees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
there march great herds of the white-bearded gnus, that
remind one so of small buffaloes. Slowly they make
their way to the more open grazing ground and disperse
themselves over it. But careful watch is kept by a few
of them&mdash;the bulls that lead the herds, experienced old
fellows! Under their guardianship the herd feels itself
perfectly safe. There is also an unusually large drove
of the wonderfully graceful impallah or black-tailed antelope.
What a remarkable contrast is presented as the
herds mingle together! The gnus, strongly built, haughty
in their bearing, conscious of their strength against
all animal foes, stand out wonderfully amongst their
almost too graceful comrades, the impallah-antelopes.
We can plainly distinguish that the females and those
that are accompanied by young ones keep more together,
while the bucks of the impallah-antelopes keep apart
and look after their safety.</p>

<p>Now a dark black mass slowly separates itself from
a large group of trees. It is followed by several forms
that do not so easily catch the eye. Our field-glasses tell
us that a small flock of ostriches has come to mix with
the wild species already noted. Now there are perhaps
well over three hundred head of these three kinds of
wild animals united together in one gathering. They
are used to come together in the most friendly way,
without apparently taking much notice of each other.
For a long time the sight of these creatures, all so
different, holds us fascinated. But our optical instruments
must restlessly explore the distance for new sights of
the animal kingdom; and at the same time there are even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>

better instruments of investigation at work&mdash;the eyes of
my black companions.</p>

<p>“Pharu, bwana!” now whispers one of my men,
and points cautiously with his arm down to a certain
point on the plain. His caution, however, is not necessary,
for it is at a distance of at least a thousand yards that
his sharp eyes have distinguished the outlines of two
almost invisible rhinoceroses that are moving slowly
through a group of acacias. What an effect that word
“pharu” has upon me! For once more there has come
close to me one of those strange, mighty beings that
really belong to a time long passed, and which, like the
elephant, the giraffe, the zebra, the gnu, and a few other
forms, lend to the wilderness the charm of primeval
days. Naturally still stronger is the effect of the cry
of “Tembo!” on the hunter and the watcher amid such
scenes. “Elephant!” This name electrifies even the
weariest traveller. But when the word is “Twigga!”
(“Giraffe!”)&mdash;even here in Europe the strange, slender-necked
creature, moving in some acacia wood all flooded
with the sunlight, comes up bodily before me&mdash;bodily and
plainly to be seen, but alas, only in imagination!</p>

<p>After trying for a minute, I succeed in getting the
massive creatures sharply defined in the middle of the
field of my glass. But the clear view of them is
something that comes and goes. Several times it looks
as if the velt had swallowed them up; then they suddenly
come into sight again, being specially visible to the eye
when they show themselves sideways. Seen from front
or rear, particularly when at rest, they are all but invisible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
We are in luck; the rhinoceroses are ambling towards
us, and come nearer and nearer, slowly following the
line of some hollows in the ground.</p>

<p>Now, borne on strong pinions, and brightly illuminated
by the sunbeams, one of the great bustards cuts through
the sea of air, and sinks down into some low ground
far away below us. This is not an unusual sight in the
late hours of the afternoon, and soon after we see not
only some more of the same species, but also three
other bustards of a smaller and commoner species that is
more active in flight. It is the <i>Otis gindiana</i>, which I
have got to like so much on account of its charming
gambols on the wing, that must be a pleasure to every
lover of birds. At this time of day it carries on this
strange tumbling in the air, and if the day is hot and
dry it makes for the neighbourhood of the water, or in
any case for certain hollow places of the velt that
provide it with at least a certain amount of soft vegetable
food. Another picture! A great flock of splendidly
coloured crested cranes wings its strong undulating flight
and goes away over the hill. I notice in the air the
striking appearance of the snake-vulture and a pair of
the nimble-winged Bateleur eagles, the “sky apes” of
the Abyssinians. My gaze follows them eagerly into the
distance.... In what various ways the bird world displays
its mastery of the realms of air! Our attention is riveted
now on the quiet gliding flight of the vulture in the
highest levels of the air, now on the spectacle of a
struggle in the air between some birds of prey and
some ravens or bee-eaters that are annoying them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Searching the ground as it goes, the augur buzzard (<i>Butco
augur</i>) wings its flight over the stone-strewn slopes
of the adjacent hill. Bateleur eagles wheel in graceful
circles high in air, let themselves fall down for several
yards, and then shoot up again heavenward. For hours
at a time they will carry on their strong-winged circling
and plunging through the realm of air, apparently without
effort or fatigue. Various kinds of kites show themselves
in their oscillating flight, that makes them always
so clever at escaping the gun; amongst them large
numbers of Montagu’s harrier (<i>Circus pygargus</i>, L.), which
at certain times of the year range restlessly over the
velt. Hawks and sparrow-hawks wing their rapid flight
in search of prey. In short, every kind and form of
bird flight that one can imagine! For instance, the
proud majestic flight of the larger species of vultures is
essentially distinct from the heavy flight of the small
Egyptian vultures (<i>Neophron percnopterus</i>, L.), whose
flight the Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria most aptly
described, when he remarked that at a distance the bird
might easily be mistaken for a stork.</p>

<p>It is indeed a great pleasure to follow with the eye
all the wondrously beautiful types of flight that the
African birds of prey present to us. The <i>enormous
numbers of birds of prey</i>, in a land that is nevertheless
so rich in wild life, ought to suggest some salutary
reflections to those who, here at home, with such dogged
persistence wage war with guns and pole-traps against
those creatures, which are so great an ornament to the
landscape. For my part, I would on every point support
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
the proposals of experienced men, like Freiherr von
Besserer of Munich and Dr. von Bocksberger of Marburg,
who advocate protection even for our birds of prey, at
least within the Government domains. “Let us try,”
says Von Besserer, “still to preserve them at least
within certain limits. Let us grant them some few places
of refuge. Let us not arraign them too strictly for
every theft, so that future generations may also enjoy
the spectacle of their beautiful flight.”</p>

<p>And now it seems, as if on some gigantic chess board,
move after move is being made on the plain below us.
We have hardly remarked the wild species already noted,
when we suddenly find ourselves perplexed as to which
point we shall first direct our gaze to, which is to attract
the special attention of our eyes. To our right, two great
herds of zebras come rolling along, and ever as they
move are now plainly visible, now almost disappear, as
if in regular alternation. To our left, on the crest of a
ridge that rises there, suddenly sharply defined silhouettes
appear&mdash;again it is a herd of gnus, and this time clearly
one that numbers at least a hundred and fifty head. While
our attention is still attracted by this beautiful spectacle,
my trusty comrade Abdallah suddenly lays his hand upon
my arm and, only with a glance of his eyes, indicates the
little valley that lies stretched out below our feet. This
time there is good excuse for his caution. For there,
looking as if they were cast in bronze, two of the wonderfully
beautiful giraffe-gazelles stand staring up in astonishment
at the place where we are posted. It may well be
that these timid children of the wilderness here had never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
yet been disturbed by the strange sight of a human figure.
“Ny&oacute;gga-ny&oacute;gga!” whispered the lips of my comrade.</p>

<p>It is not often that one has the chance of seeing the
ny&oacute;gga-ny&oacute;gga at such close quarters, and besides,
it is extremely difficult to watch it without being noticed
by it. It is so completely lost to sight in its surroundings,
and is so extremely timid and watchful, that I have very
seldom indeed succeeded in observing this splendid animal
before it has itself remarked my presence. When I succeeded
it was almost invariably towards evening when
it had come out to feed. It is worth while to take full
advantage of such moments, for the slightest disturbance
instantly drives it away. And so it was now. It was
not long before the two ny&oacute;gga-ny&oacute;gga, with their long
necks stretched out, disappeared in the hollows of the
broken ground that extended below the place where we
stood. After this I caught sight of them a few times
standing amongst the clumps of acacias, timid, surprised,
and watchful; then the gazelles betook themselves to the
protection of the wide velt, looking like mere points in
the distance.</p>

<p>To me it seems as if the sonorous name that the Swahili
language gives them, and also the softer name that sounds
so sweetly in the mouth of a Masai,&mdash;“Nanyad,”&mdash;best
and most fitly express their beauty, strangeness, and grace.</p>

<p>Again we turn our attention to all that is going on
below us. This time it is the rhinoceroses, which have
approached to within a few hundred yards of my post, that
most engage our attention. We observe how they nibble
here and there at the boughs of the <i>Salvadora persica</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
other shrubs, and then again rub their rough hide or their
horns against the strong trunk of a tree or on a block of
stone. They have all this time been coming gradually
nearer to the herd of gnus that we first noticed, and now
at last they stand quietly on the level ground, only a
hundred paces away from the old gnu-bulls which are
acting as sentinels.</p>

<p>And now it is I myself who am the first to make out
with the glass a third rhinoceros. “Wapi, bwana?” my
companion eagerly asks me, and as I point out to him the
place on the velt where I have picked the animal out,
he approvingly confirms my observation with the remark:
“Ndio, bwana, pharu mkubwa sana” (“Yes, master, a
very big rhinoceros!”)</p>

<p>After some time we see that it is an old and unusually
large bull; he, too, has gradually taken the same
line as his two colleagues. Our observation proves to
be correct, and we also remark before long that the
first pair of rhinoceroses we had noticed is made up of
an old cow and her nearly grown up young one.</p>

<p>More herds of zebras and gnus, and small troops of
Grant’s gazelles and of impallah-antelopes have come
into sight, and now they are joined by a whole crowd
of hartebeests, which so far have kept themselves hidden
in a side valley of the velt full of thick tall grass.</p>

<p>And now the moving mass of animal life is ever more
abundant, more varied. I notice in the valley at the foot
of my hill a string of guinea-fowl; how they hurry and
scurry about, flutter up with sounding strokes of their
wings, and then soon drop down again! And now my

attention is attracted by a pair of Bateleur eagles, that
wheel in the air, and enjoy themselves for an hour at a
time playing on the wing. They probably have made their
eyrie not far from this spot.</p>

<p>For minutes at a time the cry of the francolin rings
out clearly round about my post; then again it is silent.
My eyes can indeed see animals of many kinds, and my
sight ranges with restless efforts over the far distance; but
so far I have looked in vain for a form that is frequent and
familiar enough in this wilderness&mdash;the towering figure of
the “Twigga.”</p>

<p>Where can the giraffes be hiding to-day? Why have
they not come out to the still freshly green acacias in the
far-stretching hollow to my left, where I have already
marked their presence for whole days at a time?</p>

<p>And yet they are there, only I had failed to distinguish
them. At last I can make out their strange forms, as they
graze there among the acacias, and they stand out sharply
under the oblique rays of the sun.</p>

<p>What poetry there is in the movements of all the
various organisms that our eyes behold! Every variety of
gait, from the heavy, swinging, and nevertheless rapid
march of the pachyderms to the graceful speed of a pretty
gazelle, speaks in a language of its own to him who has
become familiar with the peculiar movements of this
animal world. Just as at the outset the strange appearance
of an animal one sees for the first time makes a
surprisingly strong impression on one, so too does the
great difference in the gait of the various species. But
they were all soon familiar to me. So now at the sight of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the giraffes I feel a pleasure and delight in their quaint
coming and going, their heads appearing and disappearing,
there below me in the midst of the green bowers of
mimosa leaves, high over which my view ranges. What
laws must be at work here too, by whose operation I am
compelled to feel all this to be so beautiful, so harmonious,
so splendid! I grasp the meaning of the words:
“Therefore I believe that life will first open its eyes in
that world of which Goethe said: ‘There is still the life
of life, and this is only form.’”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>What a splendid sight there is from my lofty look-out!
the whole of this mighty spectacle displays itself almost
without a sound that I can hear. Only a few voices of
birds, but no cry of any other animal reaches my ears.
But as the breeze rises more and more towards evening,
there begins in my immediate neighbourhood a strange
and beautiful concert, that is already familiar to me. And
now, as the wind blows more and more strongly through
the perforated gall-nuts that hang on every tree above
us, there resounds through the desert silence a strange
melody, a strange language of musical notes that only
the sound of the &AElig;olian harp can to some degree
represent.</p>

<p>These nut-galls on the acacias are bored quite through,
and in many cases become the dwelling-places of small
ants. If one disturbs them by tapping on the outside of
their strange habitation,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> they come swarming out to fight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
with the disturber of their peace! It is not so often that
their strange ways and doings concern a human being,
but it comes to pass to-day. The watchful observer
takes delight not only in the sound of these strange
musical instruments, but also in the thought that they
give shelter to a little world of their own, a peculiarly
organised little state made up of living beings, just as the
wide endless wilderness below them is a state with the
various larger wild animals for its inhabitants.</p>

<p class="caption"><small>GRANT’S GAZELLES</small> (<i><small>GAZELLA GRANTI</small></i>, Brooke).</p></div>

<p>My diary records yet another kind of natural observatory,
a giant tree uprooted on a wooded river-bank. Here,
as it were, in the gallery of the wood, the huge trunk
felled by the storm-wind offered me an inviting seat among
its branches, and thence I enjoyed many a sight of the
animal world around.</p>

<p>There I had a view of the river close at hand, and
farther away many clearings of the wood, which at this
time of the year showed a rich display of animal life. The
ripening forest fruits had attracted into this neighbourhood
large packs of baboons. It was good to watch their busy
activity as I looked down from my observatory, where I
sat hidden by a thick growth of creeper. Great herds
of antelopes, and especially waterbuck and Grant’s
gazelles, are regularly to be found in these wide clearings
of the woods. I remember some hours of the afternoon
when the life of the forest displayed itself here in a way
that suggested Paradise. I saw at the same time a large
drove of the graceful, wonderful pallahs, and, grazing
in their immediate neighbourhood, some twenty Grant’s
gazelle bucks which had joined together to form a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
herd. The antelopes had scattered themselves over part
of the clearing, feeding on the fresh growing grass there,
but all the while keeping themselves somewhat apart
from the herd of gazelles. But they had gradually drawn
near to a party of waterbuck which were standing under
an old shady tree, and now I had an opportunity of
watching for a long time these three varieties of antelope,
all so beautiful, yet so different. To my surprise, after
some time they were joined by nine stately eland-antelopes,
whose white side-stripes made them wonderfully prominent
among the uniformly coloured coats of the waterbuck.
Amongst these animals some three hundred baboons were
moving about with a certain careless self-possession.
They were all big ones, keenly devoted to the hunt for
insects, pulling up grass and turning over stones. Some
of the older individuals meanwhile scrambled up tree
trunks for a few feet, and thence kept a careful look-out
for the approach of any possible enemy.</p>

<p>I kept as still as a mouse, knowing well that the
slightest movement would betray my presence to the
timid, keen-sighted monkeys.</p>

<p>Now a numerous herd of zebras moved through the
wood and across the clearing at a slow, careless pace.
As they moved there was a bright shimmering of the
variegated stripes of the beautiful “tiger-horses,” and
again they would often be blurred into one uniform grey.
They mingled with the waterbuck, which took very little
notice of them, and evidently had known the zebras for
a long time. It was wonderful to see the proud waterbuck,
with their horns, which are at once weapon and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
ornament, and the stallion leaders of the zebra herd all
continually on the alert watching against their enemies.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>TELEPHOTO STUDIES OF VARIOUS ATTITUDES AND MOVEMENTS OF GRANT’S GAZELLES.</small></p></div>

<p>There is a scuttling over the ground, for the little
mongoose family, that live over there among the ant-hills,
are making a sally from their fortress. Snake-like
in their swift movements, the graceful little animals seem
to glide along. Yonder two snake-vultures are looking
for reptiles. Numbers of other vultures and marabous
have flown down to the margin of the shallow water to
bathe and drink.</p>

<p>Into the midst of all this gathering of animals there
now come three ostriches, making for the fresh green
growth along the marshy edge of the river-bank, and
a number of francolins and guinea-fowl that gradually
come crowding out of the undergrowth into the clearing
to feed there. On the sandbank on which I look down
as it extends far along the course of the river, there are
some thirty huge crocodiles sunning themselves. I can
see several smaller specimens of these mail-clad lizards
on a flat part of the river margin not far from the
sandbank.</p>

<p>Yesterday, too, six giant hippopotami paid a visit to
this sandbank on the primeval river, and left tracks that
my eye can plainly see in the glowing sunshine; to-day,
however, I have waited in vain for them to show themselves.
But suddenly from the reed-beds on the opposite
bank of the stream the mighty voice of an old bull comes
booming across to me.</p>

<p>Over this most peaceful picture of animal life the
tropical sun blazes, casting deep shadows. At this hour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
of the day even the voices of the birds are generally
silent. Only the melodious piping of the organ-shrike
sounds somewhere near me, and often, too, the cries of
one or other of the baboons which is being corrected with
bangs and cuffs by an older member of the pack.</p>

<p>All the various kinds of animals assembled here get
on quite peacefully together. They often almost touch
each other, without taking the slightest notice of one
another. Even the antelope bucks, adorned with dangerously
pointed horns, make not the slightest use of their
sharp weapons against the other species. All the time
that I was looking down from my lofty seat I saw nothing
but peace and good-fellowship. And yet how quickly a
tragedy might interrupt this stillness and peace! The
tracks of lions and leopards down there, the crocodiles
on the sandbank, and the vultures hovering in the air
told me that.</p>

<p>Often in this, and in other places, I have gained an
insight into the life and ways of the animal world, and
I have thus passed many enjoyable hours. Now one,
now another species presented itself to my observation,
but it was seldom that I saw such a large number of
different species at <i>the same time</i>. But in all cases I
have found that man is a disturbing element in the
midst of such pictures of the animal Paradise. Even
where I could feel sure that the appearance of a white
man, a European, was quite unknown to the animals of
the district, even then the very moment I showed myself
the immediate result was a panic-stricken flight.</p>

<p class="caption"><small>WHITE-BEARDED GNUS AND ZEBRAS TAKING REFUGE FROM THE MIDDAY SUN UNDER THE SHADE OF THE
MSUALLI TREE.</small></p></div>

<p>I have still clearly before my eyes the picture that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
presented itself to me as I emerged from the over-growth
of creepers on the boughs of that uprooted tree.
First a shrill cry from the monkeys. In a trice the
little young ones were clinging to their mothers, and
with long bounds the whole crowd of them galloped
away over the level ground, hidden in a cloud of dust,
and disappeared on the far side of the clearing. There
a good many of them halted to look back. Of all the
animals known to me only the baboons and the spotted
hyenas take to flight in this way. The spectacle has
such a surprisingly strange and unaccustomed, almost
uncanny effect, that it always recurs to me when I think
of these animals.</p>

<p>The antelopes follow the example of the fugitive
baboons, after first rushing hither and thither, right and
left, leaping wildly into the air. At this moment the
impallah-antelopes, especially, make a splendid picture.
Bounding along as if on springs of steel, they shoot
up several yards high into the air. Wherever the eye
turns it sees the graceful forms of these beautiful
animals in all possible positions, making long bounds,
some four feet high off the ground, and in every other
attitude that one can imagine. But the end of all these
splendid pictures, each seen for a moment, is a general
stampede. Whirling clouds of dust in the far distance
tell for some time longer which way the fugitives have
taken.</p>

<p>But it is not every day that such varied pictures,
so richly stored with the life of the primitive animal world
of the tropics, present themselves to the traveller. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
it needs, too, a trained eye to enjoy all the separate
impressions in their combined effect, as making up one
masterpiece of Nature. But often, too, an almost too great
wealth of beauty gathered together in a small space
presents itself to our eyes. Thus, more especially, I
keep a memory of these small idyllic lakes of the wilderness,
that are hidden away here and there in the Ny&iacute;ka
district, and give a home to a wealth of animal life that
often seems almost too abundant. We sometimes find
one of the most interesting species of the larger mammalia,
the hippopotamus, living here in somewhat narrow quarters,
but thus more easily accessible to observation than in
the great lake basins, where it lives in hundreds or
thousands, but where also it can much more easily get
away from the sight of the observer. It is true that
one can see numerous heads emerging from the water
in the distance, one can mark the thin spray of water
blown from their nostrils, forming numbers of little fountain
jets that glitter in the sun. But the peculiar life and
activity of these giants of the animal world goes on chiefly
at night, invisible to our eyes. In the smaller lakes it is
all different.</p>

<p>I remember with pleasure a certain gathering of
hippopotami in one of the lakes that lie hidden away
between Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru, and which were
discovered some years ago by Captain Merker. When
I saw them there were still living in them some hundreds
of hippopotami, and it was easy to watch their doings
in the water. Gathered in herds they played about in
the water under the bright sunlight, showing little sign
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
of timidity. Especially the young ones, that were still
going about with their mothers, had so little fear that
I sometimes saw them rising almost completely out of
the water. They were also sometimes to be seen resting
in the sunshine on the sandbanks by the lake margin.
Some of these lakes were of such small extent that the
animals had to come up to breathe at a distance of at
most only some twenty yards from the observer. But all
the same they were generally inhabited by quite a number
of hippopotami. It was then a great pleasure to watch these
beasts for hours at a time, from the lofty look-out place
provided by the surrounding heights that rose steeply
from the edge of the lake. They kept up good fellowship
with the crowds of water and marsh fowl that give life
to these lakes. All these animals displayed themselves
to the spectator at as close quarters and as plainly as in
a zoological garden. The rosy red pelicans fishing in
flocks of hundreds at a time presented the most charming
contrast to the uncouth quadrupeds. Even now in fancy
these lakes come before my sight, lakes that lie far from
all human ways and doings in a silent solitude. Dark
clouds float over it. The proximity of the massive and
dark Mount Meru often causes a cloudy veil to hang over
that volcanic plateau with its crater lakes. Again I climb
the steep cliffs that ring them round, and again my gaze
sweeps over the level surface of the water. But though
there has been no decrease in the numbers of the waterfowl
that enliven the lakes, the hippopotami have, alas!
disappeared. I found on the occasion of my last journey
a small number still there, but I hear from Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Sj&ouml;stedt,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> the Swedish naturalist, who lately visited these
lakes, that the hippopotami, who had made the lakes
their home since dim far-off times, have almost disappeared.
The Boers<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> have killed everything. I came
upon one here some years ago who was killing a lot of
the hippopotami; others have followed up the work of
this forerunner with more serious results. Attempts to
make settlers at home in primitive regions are almost
always inconsistent with a protection of the primitive
animal world, even though these animals inhabit lonely
upland lakes, hidden away in the wilderness, far from
human settlements.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus in memory picture follows picture.</p>

<p>Besides the harmonies of the wilderness, the impressions
of the eye are always those that come back
alluringly in my recollections. However truly the artist
may be able to reproduce all these various impressions,
there is one kind that will always be missing from his
pictures, namely, all the fleeting <i>movement</i>. To take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
as an instance only one out of an abundance of forms,
who can reproduce in pictures the endless variety of birds,
the world of winged life! Every day added to my knowledge
of these multitudinous flocks, through the increase
day by day of my bird collection, which I obtained at
the cost of much labour, and which has been the means
of giving to science many hitherto unknown species.
As I added each new bird to it, I added also to my
knowledge of these beautiful creatures, as yet so little
known, and slowly, very slowly I became familiar with
them. What splendour of forms and colours! In what
enormous flocks does the feathered race inhabit the
wilderness and the primeval forest! The Biblical account
of the flocks of quails in the desert sounds to us like a
legend, and yet it is no legend. At times when we too
were marching across the same kind of ground, there flew
past us with a whirr of many wings huge flocks of quails,
that sought and found their safety in flight. At times
I have also seen similar flocks of snipe. How long has
it been since both these kinds of birds appeared in such
flocks in our country at home?</p>

<p>The endless variety of form and colour, the movements
of the animals which the eye perceives under the ever-changing
tropical light, that shows everything brilliantly
and sharply defined, all this taken together makes up
memory-pictures of a charm that nothing can surpass.

<p>The huge sea-turtle comes creeping along, emerges
from the waters of the Indian Ocean, and makes for the

sandhills to lay its eggs there. Its giant track on the
sand leads me to its nest. To my astonished eyes this
peculiar track looks as if a ploughshare had torn through
the ground.</p>

<p>The Indian Ocean, which is the home of this huge
sea-turtle, shelters also in quiet bays the strange Dugong
or sea-cow, and great is the surprise of even the natives
themselves when from time to time they capture in their
nets this remarkable creature, which is becoming rarer
every year.</p>

moments! It may be that memory conjures up for us the
delightful fairy-like image of a rare dwarf antelope seen
perhaps once only in the shades of the forest, a dwarf
antelope that, with strange large eyes and ears alert,
watches one’s approach, and then like a flash of lightning
disappears in the thickets; it may be that in memory
one sees the reddish brown, mud-smeared body of a giant
elephant emerge from the midst of some densely tangled
primeval forest; it may be that a tree suddenly bursting
into bloom yields me a wonderfully beautiful new kind of
bird, which I grasp in my hand, delighted with its robe
of feathers; it may be that suddenly the massive giant
form of a rhinoceros appears before me in the tall grass,
unexpected, menacing, standing as if chiselled out of stone;
it may be that my free gaze ranges without limit over the
wide prospect, and sees in primitive abundance the strange
life of the tropics; in every case the impressions received
seem to the beholder fascinating beyond description.</p>

<p>Monotonous as the surroundings of the landscape may
appear to the newcomer, poor and barren though the
velt may seem to be for weeks at a time, yet, enlivened
and permeated by the mighty flood of all this strange
animal life, it has a beauty and a charm whose influence
no one can escape who makes his way into the midst
of it with open heart and eyes.</p>

<p>He who looks around him with clear-sighted vision,
and tries to see more than others, has revealed to him
the beauties of Nature in the greatest and most wonderful
way, and is drawn in the highest sense of the word to
admiration of them. Here is verified, as Sir Harry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Johnston says in his preface to my first book, “the old
nursery story of eyes and no eyes.”</p>

<p>It is thus that I lie for long hours in the wilderness,
and observe, admire and enjoy. What a wealth of
impressions is brought before the eyes among these
ever-changing, at first strange but gradually familiar sights,
in the midst of the foreign-looking landscape, bathed in
a light that has a marvellous influence, and in its full
power is almost blinding.</p>

<p>Now the dwarfs, and again the giants of the animal
world rivet our attention. But it is especially the <i>primeval
abundance</i>, the great profusion of large and small wild
life, that gives an impression that is now delightful, now
overwhelming. One must have seen, with the eye of
the hunter, gigantic old bull-elephants in the primeval
forest, great herds of rhinoceroses and giraffes in one
single day, thousands of zebras and antelopes gathered
together&mdash;one must have felt all this profuse wealth of
life, to be able to understand its full beauty and grandeur.</p>

<p>Yet there are days when one looks around in vain for
all this life and activity, when, on account of the weather,
or some other reason, the animals do not show themselves
so freely. One must also take due account of the
extensive periodical migrations of the African fauna.
<i>Many an erroneous judgment as to the alleged scarcity
of wild life, in districts in which other hunters pursued
the chase at an earlier date with success, is to be thus
explained.</i></p>

<p>But, on the other hand, there are also days when
such an abundance of animal forms presents itself to

our eyes, that the most lively imagination can form no
idea of all this profusion. On such days, I have often
wished that one could have a gigantic photographic
apparatus, an instrument that would be capable of making
a record of all I saw. But on such days, also, I have
more than once made a mental apology to explorers
whose lives have long closed in death. When, for instance,
in former years I had looked over the sketches of the
late Cornwallis Harris, sketches showing the life of the
South African fauna as he saw it about the year 1837,
I more than once had my doubts about the correctness
of his representations of it. As the result of what I
myself have seen, I have quite given up such doubts.</p>

<p>The original sketches left to us by Cornwallis Harris
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
(which I must say do not always rise to a high level
From the artistic point of view<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>) are coloured sketches
accompanied by descriptions, and show us such multitudes
of wild animals that they seem to border on the fabulous.
For we see in them elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes,
buffaloes, zebras and antelopes, all gathered together in
crowds, and thus one inclines involuntarily to the opinion
that all these have been brought together in one picture
merely to give illustrations of the various species. But
my own observations have shown me that our artist is
perfectly correct. One sees how necessary it is to make
documentary records of such observations. The men of
a later time, as I plainly realise, may be able to place
before themselves a picture of all this primitive abundance
of animal life only with the greatest trouble and by
means of earnest study of every authority bearing on
the matter.</p>

<p>Enormous periods of time must have gone by to
develop all the beauty and splendour of this so varied
and so highly organised life. My thoughts range over
far distant times. I see, looking so near that it seems
as one could touch it with one’s hands, one of the
mightiest volcanoes of our earth gradually unveiling
itself and stripping off its robe of clouds. The volcanic
regions below it remind me of the story of how all my
surroundings were developed.</p>

so much beauty, which no hostile hand has yet come to
destroy, the scene around me is so splendid that my eyes
keep ranging over it, more and more eager to contemplate
all its splendours.</p>

<p class="caption"><small>IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME VULTURES AND MARABOUS FLY DOWN FROM AN EXTREME HEIGHT IN THE AIR TO FALL

<p>A strange feeling comes over me. I think of all the
beautiful spots of our old world. They have all been
taken possession of under carefully devised arrangements
and methods, well protected by the eye of the law, and
often only occasionally open to access, and then on condition
of payment. But the beauty I am contemplating
has now been hopelessly abandoned to intruders, who
have neither knowledge nor taste nor sense, and who are
at this moment so barbarously destroying it.</p>

<p>But these thoughts must give way to others that are
more pleasant and consoling. How wonderful to be able
to revel in this wilderness, to feel in oneself the influence
of all these splendours, notwithstanding all dangers and
all difficulties, however great! Everything around us
undulates and shimmers, bathed in a dazzling sea of light.
Gradually the colouring of plain and hills, the dome of the
sky and the whole surrounding landscape, changes to duller
and less definite tints. The sun-illumined air rises in
waves from the earth, and the various strata of it form an
ever-changing chaos of reflected light. Over all there is
deep peace. A spell that accords with the mood of the
moment seems to stream down from the dome of the sky
over this solitude, lying so far from the noisy activity of
the world.</p>

<p>All that I here behold has been going on since those
far times, directed by natural law, in ever-recurring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
succession. But to-day for the first time a member of
the complex society of civilisation takes delight in this
mountain rising amidst all this primeval beauty.</p>

<p>Who could possibly set down this poetry upon paper&mdash;the
poetry of the velt and its wild inhabitants, the moods
of East African Ny&iacute;ka? The master of colouring has not
yet arisen who could give us a picture of these mighty
gatherings of wild herds, and of these deserts that seem
overcrowded with animal forms, that yet live so peacefully
together, nor can the master of the pen, though he may
have been able by his words to conjure up some idea of
them in the mind.</p>

<p>One who has perhaps felt and enjoyed their spell more
than any one else is Alfred Brehm. But he has travelled
only in regions that had long been under the influence of
man and his activity. He has only once seen the king of
beasts, and has never looked upon the giraffe&mdash;whose
beautiful eyes the Arab compares with the eyes of his
beloved&mdash;and many other forms of the African fauna.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
Nevertheless he has done wonders, thanks to his deep
feeling for his subject, his intimate understanding of it,
and his incomparably poetical power of description. He
has given us imperishable pictures in words that are among

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
the most beautiful that have ever been written about Nature.
Our old famous teacher, Dr. Schweinfurth, has seen and
described similar scenes. With these two we may rank in
equal honour the name of the German explorer Richard
B&ouml;hm,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> who unhappily lost his life so tragically and at such
an early age on the shores of Lake Up&auml;mba in Southern
Ur&uacute;a, of which he was the discoverer. Many others
might also be named who were deeply influenced by these
primeval splendours. But the fauna of South Africa
has vanished unsung and untamed, before any artist or
master of words arose to place in a fitting way its beauties
on record for all time!</p>

<p>Masters of words like Ludwig Heck, by whose
skilful pen the life of the mammalia has been lately
described anew for us in Brehm’s <i>Tierleben</i>, and like
Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche, would perhaps have been capable of
grasping, and reproducing the impressions that the
traveller feels in those far lands. But they have never
trodden these distant countries, and they must therefore
confine themselves to describing artistically and yet truly
what they have never actually seen, from ideas based
on their own clear understanding of the observations
of others.</p>

<p>The sun is setting. It is time for me to come down
from my hill and return to my camp. The sun goes to
his rest in flaming splendour, there is a glowing radiance
of violet and purple light; soon dark night will surround
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
me. Thoughtfully I tread my homeward way, with my
mind richly stored with impressions, but anxious as to my
efforts to describe all that I have seen, and doubtful as
to my success.</p>

<p>“To have passed a thousand and more days, a
thousand and more nights in the wilderness with a great
longing in my heart in some way to grasp and make my
own all the splendour I have seen and all its charm;
to have again and again delighted in the beauty of the
Ny&iacute;ka: this does not make me capable of reproducing
it. And even if after many decades of years I could
fully comprehend it, I should never succeed in reproducing
it in its full significance and bringing it home to the
minds of those who have never looked upon it with their
own eyes.”</p>

<p>So runs a passage in my diary.</p>

<p>Descriptions of things similar to those that I have
told of in inadequate words in these slight sketches of the
Ny&iacute;ka district of East Africa may be read of other regions
of our earth. The life and activity of the Arctic fauna,
of those gigantic creatures of to-day, the whales, and of
the Polar bears, the musk oxen, the wild reindeer, the
walruses, the seals&mdash;those most sagacious creatures&mdash;and
the life of many other animal forms&mdash;all these together
are waiting for the hand that will describe them in word
and picture and put on enduring record for all time this
changing life. Thus only will a new existence be given
to those forms of life for which the sentence “Vae Victis!”
has gone forth.</p>

give us a noble and true picture of the East African
Ny&iacute;ka in all its vast proportions. For, as the night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
is now descending on the wilderness, so will an everlasting
night soon come down upon all the life and movement
that I have tried so inadequately to describe in merest
outline.</p>

The Voices of the Wilderness</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> German sportsman knows well the mysterious
charm that speaks to the listener, when in the
woods in spring he hears the note of the woodcock and
the cry of the ptarmigan, and when in autumn he hears
the call of the stag to its mate. It must be that the
listener is subject to some atavistic influence, some
impulse rooted in the dim past now quickening into life.</p>

<p>Let him who understands this charm follow me through
the equatorial wilderness, and listen with me to the music
of songs and notes that we may call the language of
the Ny&iacute;ka. We shall hear it there on every side, by
day and by night. True, fully to understand this language
one should have King Solomon’s magic power, which
made its possessor understand the speech of animals, or
like Siegfried have dipped one’s hand in the blood of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
the dragon, and thus have acquired the gift of holding
converse with the birds.</p>

<p>This much is certain, in the wildernesses of Africa
this primeval language is still to be heard. In our hunting
grounds at home the voices of the aurochs, the bison,
the ibex, the bear, the lynx, and the wolf have been
silenced, and many other voices that have belonged to
the wild open country since primeval days have all but
died away. I have indeed learned to understand only
a few words of this language of the wilderness, though
I have heard thousands of its sounds. But I may be
able to tell something about it.</p>

<p>What a strong and deep impression this world of
sound makes upon the traveller at so many hours of the
day and night! Every region, every different kind of
country has its own characteristic harmony. One does
not always hear it&mdash;it depends upon the season of the
year and the time of the day, on the changes of weather,
and much else. But when one has become even to some
small extent familiar and conversant with these various
voices, one enjoys this music-language Of the Ny&iacute;ka with
a sense of deep delight and ever growing understanding.
Sometimes it is most difficult to find out the names of
the individual speakers. Often they keep very quiet;
they seem to be like great vocalists on tour: they appear
suddenly, and then disappear again for a long time,
without letting one see any more of them. Then the
traveller may often listen long, in vain, for the singer&mdash;gone
without leaving a trace behind. But it is not only the
soloists that charm us. There is also the combined effect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of all the voices of nature uniting in one vast impressive
chorus. This has made such an impression upon me
that I shall try, so far as my limited powers permit, to
describe it to the reader. This musical language of the
wilderness is in itself powerful, rich and impressive, but
all this in a still greater degree for him who, observing
things with the eyes of a seer, knows many of the voices
that resound in it will not be heard much longer.
Although for long, long ages, through hundreds of
thousands of years, this tumult of sound has been heard,
these voices, or many of them, will soon be silent victims
of civilisation! They are going, and with them many of
the euphonious names of places with which the natives
have distinguished every spot, but which the Europeans,
as they penetrate into the country, feel themselves obliged
to change.</p>

<p>It may seem that I myself am not quite guiltless
of such misdeeds. It is true that I named an
island, that resort of the wild buffaloes in the Pangani
River, “Heck Island,” in honour of Professor Ludwig
Heck. But the island had till then no name whatever.
One feels sad, on glancing over the map of Africa,
to note the degradation of so many old traditional
names, which is in no way justified, and is a sign of
the hasty and violent introduction of civilised life. “The
Boers are not people who think much about natural
history,” says a writer somewhere. And in fact, through
their agency, the euphonious names of the various wild
species of South Africa are now to a great extent already
obsolete. They hastily gave vulgar-sounding names of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
their own to the wild animals.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Thus the oryx antelope
became the “gemsbock,” and the cow-antelope, because
it was tenacious of life and difficult to kill, the “hartebeest.”
The gnu, on account of its wildness, was called
the “wildebeest,” the bustard the, “pauw,”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> the hyena the
“wolf,” and the giraffe&mdash;incredible though, it may seem&mdash;the
“kameel”! Hand in hand with this went the changing
of place-names: so we read of “Hartebeests Fontein,”
“Olifants River,” “Kameeldoorn,” “Zwartkop,” and we
have a whole series of unpleasant, and sometimes utterly
ugly names by the introduction of which the beautiful
aboriginal names of various places have become obsolete.
Thus not only do the primitive inhabitants of the land
disappear, but their names, too, are blown away upon
the wind.</p>

<p>Countless are the voices that resound by day in the
Ny&iacute;ka. But by night these voices speak still more
mysteriously and wonderfully to him who listens to them,
bringing him into still closer union with nature. From
the multitude of these voices I choose a few only.</p>

<p>Old memories come back to me! It is in the year
1896. I have just landed, and am sitting in my night
shooting-encampment by an inlet of the sea near Dar-es-Salaam.
A concert of the voices of nocturnal birds
mingles with the sharp buzz of the mosquitoes. Again
and again one hears a strange cry. Unspeakably sad
and monotonous, this peculiar sound rings out over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
waters of the inlet; in the distance a changing answer
comes back in response to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i318" src="images/i318.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>FLIGHT OF SANDFOWL.</small></p></div>

<p>I did not then suspect <i>that it would take me nearly
a year</i> to be absolutely certain that this sound was
uttered by an extremely shy and restless kind of
cuckoo!</p>

<p>This sound of the African night always made the
strongest impression upon me, and remains indelibly in
my memory. All that one heard from near at hand,
or from the distance miles away, had its origin not in
man’s voice or in human activity of any kind, but most
come from birds and beasts to a great extent unknown
to us. One had to interpret, to conjecture, to build
up theories. Often one struck upon the correct solution.
But often enough, too, the interpretation one accepted
proved to be false, and then one’s anxiety to find out
the true solution, aroused anew, was doubly keen. The
first time I heard it, I had no difficulty in interpreting
for myself the cry of the monkeys harassed in the
night by leopards, a screaming of a kind one cannot
easily forget, plainly expressing the greatest terror. The
first time one heard the neighing of the herds of zebras
it was much more difficult to recognise the sound, and
the gobbling cry of the ostrich had at first a still
stranger effect. But as soon as I had heard the voice
of the zebras a few times, it was clear to me that the
extinct <i>quagga</i> of South Africa must have derived its
name from its cry. If one puts the accent on the
second syllable, and pronounces the <i>g</i> softly and deep
in the throat, one has, as one repeats it, a wonderful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
reproduction of the cry of the zebra as I heard it
myself.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>What a pity that all this cannot be put on permanent
record by some such apparatus as a gigantic phonograph!
But unfortunately we are still a long way from such a
possibility.</p>

<p>No one will be surprised at my keeping specially in
mind that endlessly melancholy cry of the cuckoo in the
darkness. How lonely and empty our German woodlands
would seem without the cuckoo and the cuckoo cry!
As a matter of fact the African primeval forest <i>never</i>
hears the same cry that has become so clear to ourselves.
Our cuckoo, migrating in a few days all the way from
the north to the equator, flies in restless haste through
wood and plain, but <i>he is silent</i>. His cry is heard only
in our country at home. But in the East Africa district
of Pori, amongst many other cries those of two species
of cuckoo are heard in rivalry. These are the sickle
cuckoo&mdash;the “Tipi-tipi” of the Swahili&mdash;a reddish-brown
fellow that flutters in heavy flight everywhere about the
bush, the reedy bogs and hill-slopes; and the solitary
cuckoo (<i>Cuculus solitarius</i>, Step.), about whose cry I
was for a long time mistaken. The unceasing, low cry
of the former, the sickle cuckoo, if it is heard even a
few times, can never again be forgotten. It sounds like&mdash;“Dut-d&uacute;t&mdash;dududu&mdash;dut-d&uacute;t.”
One hears it by day and
also in the darkest night, contrasting strongly with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
sharply defined, clear note of our European cuckoo, though
the latter listens in silence to the cry of his cousins all
through the winter under the equator. This cry seems
to me, with its low, dull, softly prolonged tones&mdash;so
different from the louder cry of its northern relative&mdash;to
be quite in keeping with its mysterious tropical home.
For the sickle cuckoo knows all its deepest mysteries,
and no bird ranges so unweariedly through the densest
thickets and over the most inaccessible regions. In the
most hidden, solitary, and unknown spots<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> it would come
fluttering up from the ground at my feet, often startling
me. It seemed to me as if the bird wanted to call my
attention to newly discovered mysteries, as its “Dut-d&uacute;t&mdash;dududu&mdash;dut-d&uacute;t”
came sounding to me, now here, now
there, low, soft and melodious, by day under the brooding
noonday heat, and just the same in the midnight hours.</p>

<p>At night, too, he is seconded, as I have already
mentioned, by his more timid cousin, with an ever
repeated “K&iacute;-k&uuml;-k&uuml;&mdash;k&iacute;-k&uuml;-k&uuml;,” that resounds monotonously
in the distance.</p>

<p>There is a strange charm in continually hearing these
voices again and again, without knowing the little singers;
and a triumph at last in making out which they are.</p>

<p>“During a sleepless night,” said Richard Wagner,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>“I once went out upon the balcony of my window on
the Grand Canal at Venice. As if in a deep dream the
legend-haunted city of the lagoons lay spread out before
me under the darkness. Out of the soundless silence
there came the loud call of a gondolier waking up just
then on his boat ... then from the farthest distance
the same call answered back along the dark canal; I
recognised the old, melancholy, melodious sounds, doubtless
as old as the canals of Venice and their people. After
a solemn pause the far-sounding dialogue at last began,
and it seemed to me to melt into harmony, till the notes
heard close at hand and coming more softly from afar
died away as sleep came back to me again.”</p>

<p>Who could describe in such noble words the impression
made upon our minds by the spell of the sounds and
songs of the nocturnal wildness, and all its strange and
beautiful music? All that at first is strange there, and
even alarming, comes gradually to be something one
loves intimately. Shall I ever be able to listen to it all
again? Who knows? Let me try then to make some
record of what I have so often heard, and in these few
sentences attempt to give some faint echo of these once
familiar voices.</p>

<p>We are in the midst of the great forest. Giant
podocarpus and juniper trunks rise up towards the sky.
It is cool and shady all around us here; we breathe a
moist, and not unfrequently a musty air. The sunlight
plays only upon the tops of these giants of the primeval
woods, and can but scantily illumine the almost bare
ground below them, sending here and there shimmering,
dancing rays of light amongst the tree-trunks. High
overhead the giants arch their branches, interlacing them
in a vast living roof of green. Only where clearings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
make a break in the mass of trees, a sea of light floods
all the ground&mdash;a flood of light so strong that our eyes,
accustomed to the obscurity, the mysterious semi-darkness
of the forest, are dazzled, and there comes to our minds
involuntarily recollections of old Bible pictures, in which
such floods of light are shown streaming down from
heaven to earth. A confusion of trees, creepers and
undergrowth, with amidst it uprooted tree-trunks lying
mouldering away; the earth black, and often marshy;
no road or way far and wide, but only here and there
the tracks and beaten paths made by the elephants and
rhinoceroses that have roamed the old forest since primeval
times.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>ZEBRAS AND GNUS.</small></p></div>

<p>Deep silence all around. If the traveller stands still
and holds his breath, this silence seems to weigh down
upon the soul with a weird force. At such moments
it is as though some vague disaster threatened, or something
wicked and dangerous were creeping around unseen.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a squealing and chattering. There is a
scurry up and down the tree-trunks, and again there
is a strange sound of spitting and growling. Just now
there had come over us a feeling such as is expressed
in B&ouml;cklin’s<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> masterly picture, directly inspired by nature,
<i>Schweigen des Waldes</i> (the “Silence of the Forest”).
We had almost expected each moment that legends set
before us by the power of his genius would here become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
realities; we felt that here one might surprise nymphs
and dryads. The spell is soon broken. The gnomes
of the primeval forest, the tree-climbing hyraxes, have
scared away the silence. Wonderful to say, these dwarfish
<i>hoofed animals</i>, the nearest still surviving relatives of the
rhinoceros, are here scrambling up and down on the
trunks of the venerable trees.</p>

<p>From all sides, from every spot, every direction,
there resound the same cries, and again there is silence
all around us. Here, far in the depths of the primeval
forest, the bird world seems to have no home. But
hark! I hear a curious chirping, and I notice on a bare
bough above me one of the most gloriously coloured of
African birds, the banded trogon (<i>Heterotrogon vittatum</i>,
Shell.), which, uttering a most peculiar sound, is carrying
on its characteristic sport&mdash;flapping its beautiful wings.</p>

<p>Then loud-sounding trumpet-like notes break on
the ear. We hear a rushing in the air, and big hornbills
with their huge beaks come sailing, as I judge
by their cries, through the air, and alight on the top
of a giant juniper (<i>Juniperus procera</i>). They, too, fly
away after awhile; their trumpeting, dies away in the
distance, and again there is silence all around. Their
voices and that of the brightly coloured helmet-bird give
to the primeval forest of Africa a strange charm that
is all its own.</p>

<p>But now there suddenly breaks forth a remarkable
sound, rising and again falling as I listen, a strange music
of a most peculiar kind. It is the chatter of the colobus
monkeys, a sound that cannot be described in words.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
A party of these wonderful creatures seems to be in good
humour, for their song comes to me in chorus unceasingly,
and in rising strength. “Mur&uacute;h-mur&uacute;h-mur&uacute;h-rrrrrrm&uacute;h
rrrrrrm&uacute;h-mur&uacute;h quoi-quo-quo-quo-rrrr,” it sounds, now
swelling strongly out, now gently dying away. These,
too, are doomed to death, who now are letting us hear
their primitive song, that in our days may so easily be
their death-song; for these monkeys are keenly hunted
for the sake of their beautiful fur, and their song often
betrays them to the hunter, eager for their spoils. Some
poisoned darts, which I find here with points as sharp
as needles, and which were once shot with a bad
aim at the little monkeys, are evidence enough of this.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i328" src="images/i328.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><small>AN ALARUM-TURACO</small> (<i><small>CHIZAERHIS LEUCOGASTRA</small></i>) <small>IN ITS PLACE OF SAFETY
AMONG THE ACACIA THORNS.</small></p></div>

<p>And again I hear the great wood ringing and echoing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
with the countless cries of birds. There was a time,
too, when the call of millions of the now all but extinct
passenger pigeon resounded in North America; so, too&mdash;and
of this I have no doubt&mdash;the cooing of the ringdoves
was heard repeated by thousands of birds in our beech
and oak woods at home when the acorns and beech-nuts
were in season.</p>

<p>On the lonely uninhabited western slopes of the
highest giant mountain of the German possessions, Mount
Kilimanjaro, certain forest fruits flourish in profusion.
There is heard on every side a strong, sweet-sounding
dove-note, like that of our ringdove. A handsome large
species of wood-pigeon (<i>Columba aquatrix</i>, Tem.) has
gathered in hundreds of thousands. The rustle of their
wings, as they rise or come down in great flocks,mingles
with their beautiful calls and cries; the ear can hear
nothing else. Voice, form, and movement so strongly
remind one of our own ringdoves that one feels carried
away to far-off, familiar scenes, and the illusion is helped
by the character of the Kilimanjaro landscape, which in
certain of the higher regions has less of a tropical than
of a northern aspect. How strange it is; the cry of
this bird all at once transports the traveller to his own
land! Truly <i>there is a magic in sound</i>. With the poorest
appliances, the slightest equipment, the creative fancy
can in a moment build a bridge to the Fatherland. The
call of this beautiful dove sounding here on every side,
its love-inspired circling high in air above the tops of
the giants of the primeval forest, surrounds it with a
dream-picture, and makes me suddenly breathe the air
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
of the beech woods. I am in the northern woods in
springtime; cool and fragrant the northern air blows
round me. But ah! thousands of miles of land and sea
divide me from all that, and cool reflective reason counts
only on the possibility, not the certainty, of my ever
seeing my native land again.</p>

<p>And yet this beautiful picture has a strengthening
and consoling influence. It drives away the trouble of
home-sickness&mdash;a dismal thing!</p>

<p>I can hear many other voices besides these in the
primeval forest. But those that impress themselves in
the most completely enduring way on the memory are
the strange cry of the tree-hyrax, the peculiar note
of the hornbills, that calling of the doves, the remarkable
chorus of song of the ‘Mbega monkeys, strange beyond
all description, and the trumpeting of the lord of the
primeval forest, the elephant.</p>

<p>Another tone-picture&mdash;an early morning at a drinking-place
in the desert. One could feel the cold in the
night, but the quick coming warmth of the equatorial
sun’s rays has soon roused the animal world to active
life. There is the cry and call of the francolins on all
sides. But the chief part in this early concert is taken
by the thousands of turtle-doves, flying from all directions
to the water. Everywhere a murmuring and cooing, that
the Masai are able to re-echo so incomparably in the
name of the turtle-dove in their language&mdash;“‘Ndurgulyu.”
As an accompaniment to this, there is the rustling
and wing-clapping of all the feathered visitors at the
water. Towards evening, the air in the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
of a much-visited drinking-place is literally filled with
these beautiful and swift-winged birds. The rustling and
beating of their wings in rapid flight makes in itself a
concert. I not unfrequently came upon places that bore
the name of the “Doves’ water,” or the “Doves’ resting-place.”
All the various voices of the many species of
doves that find a home in the Ny&iacute;ka resound again in
the traveller’s ears for years after. Whether it be the
strange voice of the parrot-pigeon, that ushers in the
concert with a hollow “Kruh-kruh” and follows it up
with some remarkable notes, or the melancholy cry of
the little steel-spotted pigeon that comes to us from the
thickets, or the strong, loud-sounding love-notes of
the already-mentioned <i>Columba aquatrix</i>, Tem., so like
our ringdove, or, above all, the familiar sweet voices of
the many small kinds of turtle-doves&mdash;all these sounds, the
rustling and fluttering and beating of wings, the living,
moving picture presented by all these beautiful birds,
belong inseparably to the essence and being of the
Ny&iacute;ka. When the turtle-doves greet the morning with
their soft cooing, their call is answered from afar by
strange guttural tones borne swiftly through the air,
sounding, like “Gle-gl&eacute;-l&aacute;gak-gl&eacute;-&aacute;ga-&aacute;ga,” from the velt-fowl
hurrying like themselves to the water. Brehm, in
his <i>Leben der V&ouml;gel</i>, has already raised a poetical
monument to them made up of beautiful lines. But I
could not picture to myself the morning concert of the
bird world in the Ny&iacute;ka without the strange cry of
the sand-fowl and the cooing of the doves, and the
peculiar sound of the beating wings of the velt-fowl as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
they rise in scattered flight from their resting-places,&mdash;a
sound that impresses itself strongly and distinctly on the
ear, more than that of any other bird I know, as the
“Kl&aacute;ck-kl&aacute;ck-kl&aacute;ck” of the rising woodcock strikes the
ear of the sportsman in Germany.</p>

<p>The wonderful flight of the velt-fowl, their calls
and cries, their hurry and bustle, afforded me ever new
interest. It always seemed to me as though the wide
wilderness here sent out its lovingly guarded favourite
children as envoys, with the mission of making it known
that even now, in this dull, barren time, life has not
died out even in the most remote deserts. So I see
and hear them once more in fancy, beautiful, timid, and
full of the joy of life. It is thus their countless millions
enliven the wastes of Africa, as well as the endless tundra
marshes of Asia.</p>

<p>Deep, long-drawn-out notes, like those of musical
glasses, ring in my ears. The brooding noonday heat
is round me. The sun is in the zenith, and hardly
another sound is to be heard all around. The wilderness
lies before me in the hot glowing sunlight as if dead.
My weary bearers have given themselves up to a dozing
sleep, at the place where I have at last halted, after a
march of many hours with a few companions.</p>

<p>Before me is a miniature mountain-world lighted up
by the dazzling sunbeams. There is a mass of precipitous
rocks, so characteristic of the Masai-Ny&iacute;ka district, that
stretches away into the distance. The Candelabra
Euphorbias spread out their strange forms against the
light, in grotesque clumps, and seem to me to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
themselves one with the rocks, whose inorganic character
and nature appear to be repeated in their characteristic
forms.</p>

<p>From out of the midst of this stony wilderness these
remarkable notes come sounding in my ears. They seem
to be mysterious voices of rock and stone. The eye
searching expectantly for the singer that is uttering
this bell-like melodious music can discover nothing.
And yet the notes come from the throat of a bird. It
is once more some hornbills that are making their song
of love and wooing resound in this wilderness. I have
been able to listen to them for hours, losing myself in
dreams, and I cannot say why I seemed to identify
precisely <i>these</i> bird-voices with the voice of the African
Sphinx, that legendary Sphinx which has sung already
to so many, and lured many back again for ever. Thus
may the songs and voices of the old sanctuaries of
Northern Africa once have been. Again and again,
when I heard it, I had to think of those men who,
with burning longing in their hearts, went forth into the
Dark Continent to wrest from it the secrets of its fauna,
but had to pay for the undertaking with their lives.</p>

<p>A burning glow of sunshine, a dazzling light in
overwhelming abundance over all the desert waste of
rock&mdash;and amidst it, again and again, that deep, ghostly,
metallic note, that directly impresses the traveller as
though it were the language of the wilderness, peculiarly
its own. But how can I describe all this in words?</p>

<p>And at a moment like this, as if to heighten the effect,
over there the voice of the mightiest bird that the earth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
bears in this our day sounds forth. I hear in the distance
the ringing cry of a hen-ostrich, and I listen to it with
attention strained to the highest point.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i334" src="images/i334.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="x-small"><i>C. G. Schillings, phot.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><small>NESTS OF WEAVER-BIRDS ON THE BOUGHS OF AN ACACIA.</small></p></div>

<p>The strange duet has now long died away. But it
often comes up to me again in the midst of the movement
of civilised life and takes me back on the wings of fancy
to the glorious beauty of the wilderness.</p>

<p>But that uncouth tropical singer is not really needed
to conjure up this frame of mind. A little unseen <i>lark</i>,
all by itself, can evoke for me the charm of the solitudes
of Ny&iacute;ka as with a magic wand.</p>

<p>How this comes to pass, I will tell the reader. We
must make a long tour. Now we are in the north, in
our native country, in the midst of the spring, amongst
spreading fields of our German homeland. The song
of the lark fills the air, and our heart expands to its
music. We go out upon the open moor. We hear a
trilling and quavering of another kind, with a strangely
sweet touch of sadness in it, especially at night&mdash;the song
of the woodlark. But now let the reader follow me to
the little island of Heligoland. In the glare from the
lighthouse, that sends afar its rays,&mdash;in this case rays that
bring destruction,&mdash;countless numbers of larks flutter
and wheel about, bewildered in the darkness of the
autumn night, and full of anxiety and fear. On a dark,
rainy October night thousands of them fall victims to
the death that lies waiting in ambush for them below
this tower raised by the hand of man. Their little wings
have brought them safe over the ocean to the small island.
But there one hears no rejoicing song, No! there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
resounds only something like an agonised cry for help
from weak creatures in the direst peril of death.</p>

<p>Millions of larks fly thus each year southwards and
northwards, obedient to that mysterious migratory impulse
that guides them on their way.</p>

<p>The song of the lark and the cry of the lark are
very different things. To those who know them they
mean a song of happy springtime, and a cry for help
in the night of death.</p>

<p>How comes it that I thus speak of, and have to think
of, sounds uttered by the birds here at home? Simply
because over there, in other lands, my fancy so often and
so readily imagined the flying bird to be a messenger,&mdash;a
courier for thoughts of home,&mdash;and connected such wishes
and longings with its appearance and disappearance.</p>

<p>In autumn, the noblest of our northern songsters
makes its way in a few days and nights into the inmost
heart of the Dark Continent. It disappears again in
spring, to return to the north over velt and desert,
morass, mountain and sea. The cuckoo, that only a
few days ago could be seen in our northern lands by the
eyes of men who knew how to recognise it, I see on the
African velt, a wandering, fleeting visitor. Thus it seems
to bring me a greeting, like that brought by our oriole,
our nightingale, and many other children of the homeland.</p>

<p>No one can be surprised that in these solitudes these
birds, and their coming and going, are closely associated
with our thoughts. It is the less to be wondered at
seeing that they are all such eloquent witnesses to the
miracle that these weak creatures with their feeble wings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
twice each year traverse continents and fly safely over
seas.</p>

<p>We cannot help thinking of the lark and its spring
song at home, when in the wilds of Africa we hear its
voice; and it appeals so impressively to the wanderer in the
wilderness, that afterwards it has the power of bringing
back by its music a picture of the Ny&iacute;ka in all its
characteristic wildness. It is a song that has a character
of its own. When I hear it, if it is in the Ny&iacute;ka,
I cannot help thinking of the songster’s frail, weak
brethren of Europe, that, following an irresistible
impulse, are perhaps at this moment meeting their
death on the little island of Heligoland&mdash;obedient to the
same instinct that sends myriads of their kind each year
towards pole or equator. For even as the northern
song of the lark awakens the soft, poetic spell of
smiling fields, so, too, the mysterious and still deeply
veiled spell of the Ny&iacute;ka can find expression in its
wonderful music.</p>

<p>Small, invisible almost, it rises in the air. Soon it is
lost to sight in the sky. Then suddenly a song that,
though so often heard before, is still a marvel, comes
distinctly on the ear, its notes sharply accented and
emphasised as if it were <i>close to us</i>. There is a sharp,
rhythmical, clapping sound, as if small laths or pieces of
whalebone were being rattled together. It comes from
that tree right in front of us. No mistake about it seems
possible. But the eye searches in vain for the producer
of the sound.</p>

<p>Again and again one is deceived in this way. Who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
could imagine that that little bird far away over there,
a hardly perceptible speck on the horizon, is producing this
strange music? “Kn&aacute;ck! kn&aacute;ck! kn&aacute;ck!” again, and yet
again, it comes to us ringing out loud and clear. Our
little invisible songster does not tire of pouring out its
strange misleading song. It is a kind of love-song of
a species of lark, which was discovered by Fischer some
fifteen years ago and bears the name of the naturalist,
now long deceased; <i>Mirafra fischeri</i>, Rchw.,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> is its
scientific name. Its clapping and rattling are undoubtedly
part of the charm of a journey in certain districts of the
Masai-Ny&iacute;ka.</p>

<p>Even in my tent, in the midst of the comparatively
loud noise of the busy camp of my numerous caravan, I
can hear the clapping, rattling voice of this lark. Some
hundreds of yards away it flies up into the sky, like our own
skylark, and hovers about clattering in the air, so loudly
and distinctly that if I did not know its character and
habits, I would have been continually looking for it close
to my tent. It is very hard to quite free oneself from
this illusion. One continually thinks that one hears the
cry of the bird in one’s immediate neighbourhood, the
sound being produced much in the same way as that of
the snipe.</p>

<p>And yet another strange voice of a lark resounds
in my ears: a melancholy, plaintive, soft sound, till
now unknown to me and to most others. All night
long its calls and cries resound about my camp. I
should never have thought that it was a lark (<i>Mirafra
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
intercedens</i> Rchw.) that thus made itself heard in the
night, as our woodlarks do in moonlight nights at
home. It was at the cost of much careful research
that the discovery was made of what bird produced this
song.</p>

<p>And the strange voice of yet another bird is inseparable
from my recollections of the wilderness of East Africa.
The xerophytic flora of the far-spreading thorny mimosa
thickets gives shelter to a privileged member of the bird
world, which is thus guarded in safety from all danger
amid their thorny boughs and branches. I refer to a
peculiar bird, belonging to the group of the Musophagid&aelig;,
grey-feathered, green-beaked, long-tailed, and adorned
with a crest. This strange fellow roves about restlessly&mdash;a
bird about as big as a jay, misleading the
traveller with his cry in the most curious way. Science
calls him <i>Chizaerhis leucogastra</i>, R&uuml;pp.; the German
language has given him the name “<i>L&auml;rmvogel</i>”
(“noisy bird”).</p>

<p>And he has a perfect right to bear his name. There
resounds somewhere near us, and in a way that completely
deceives us, now the barking and snarling of a dog, now
the bleating of sheep. Following the direction of the
sound we look to see what produces it, and we find our
bird hopping about nimbly upon the tops of the thorn-trees
and acacias, appearing to have no anxiety about
the thorny spikes of the branches, in which he makes his
home. With a cleverness that borders on the miraculous
he makes his way amongst them, protected by them
against the attacks of birds or beasts of prey, and in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
conscious reliance on the security of his dwelling-place,
so to say, mocking at all enemies. So deceptive
are his cries that at first, and especially when I was
in the neighbourhood of native settlements, I was
continually looking everywhere for sheep and their
shepherds.</p>

<p>Many other typical bird-voices live in my memory.
I hear the peculiar plaintive cry of the large cormorants
that are busy with their fishing by the salt lakes of the
wilderness, a cry that seems most fitted for these solitudes.
The mysterious chattering and chirping of the little
swamp-fowl come to my ear from the shallows and the
bushes along the banks of silent rivers of the primeval
forest, a bird-language so strange that the natives believe
the birds are conversing with the fish in the stream. I
hear the cackling of the knowing Nile-geese, that seem
to be always engaged in conversation; when on the wing,
too, a pair of them, in their affectionate fidelity, have
always some warning, some reminder of something or
other to call out to each other. Where their cry resounds
one hears also frequently that of the wonderful, wailing
peewit; it has a plaintive and melancholy effect on the
mind of the listener. Far different is the noisy outcry
of its brightly coloured cousin, a denizen of the thirsty
wilderness (<i>Stephanibyx coronatus</i>, Bodd.). Shrill and
harsh the voice of the bird rings out, a watch-cry by day
and night, and when in bright moonlight nights they fly
in flocks over the camp. Swarms of these remarkable
birds, the police of the wilderness in feathered uniforms,
flutter around the traveller as he approaches. They ruin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
his attempts to stalk wild animals, and their strident
screeches, to which all other animals hearken, haunt him
long after, as also the call and cry of the large, yellow-eyed
thick-knee, an inhabitant of the loneliest solitudes.
But I cannot imagine the low shores of African lakes
and the sea-coast without the cry of the widely distributed
sandpiper, which has its home in the far north. In winter
its low plaintive cry is heard at every step: but even in
summer the trained ear can distinguish it here and there.
These individual stragglers from the north are thus to
be found during all times of the year in this distant
country, while the most of their kindred tribe have

successfully made their way to the Polar lands, their usual
summer breeding-place.</p>

OF AN ACACIA. ITS CRIES WHEN IT SEES A HUNTER ON THE MOVE
OFTEN WARN THE ANIMALS HE IS STALKING.</small></p></div>

<p>High over my head the voice of the pretty avocet
(<i>Recurvirostra avocetta</i>, L.), one of the most charming
forms of the bird world known to us, transports me by
magic to the distant and mournful lakes of the Masailand
wilderness. What the dwarf bustards (<i>Otis gindiana</i>,
Oust.) keep calling out to each other with their continually
repeated “R&aacute;gga-ga-r&aacute;gga” is not to be discovered. But
their cry, which has kept the fancy of the natives busy
since olden days, is as inseparably associated with regions
on which the grass grows high, as the voices and cries
of the sandfowl, the francolins, and, above all, the
jarring outcries of the guinea-fowl, on the velt. All the
manifold voices of doves, cuckoos, parrots, hornbills,
bee-eaters, shrikes, orioles, starlings, finches, weaver-birds,
sylvians, and the rest, calling, exulting, rejoicing,
uttering cries of alarm or complaint, have woven themselves
into my recollections of happy days and days
of toil.</p>

<p>Thus there still rings in my ear the triple note of
the yellowish green bulbul (<i>Pycnonotus layardi</i>, Gurn.),
which, like our sparrow, is present everywhere, till one
almost tires of it. Most curious is the friendly play which
the handsomely coloured glossy starling (<i>Spreo superbus</i>,
R&uuml;pp.) carries on with a weaver-bird (<i>Dinemellia dinemelli</i>,
[Hartl.] R&uuml;pp) in flights like those of our sparrows. It
comes back to me all the more vividly when I recall
the notes uttered by these two birds, which, though such
close friends and taking such delight in each other’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
company, are so distantly related. The curious warbling
of the honey-finder (<i>Indicator indicator</i>, Gm.), which
often guides the man who follows it to a wild bees’ nest,
also easily makes a permanent impression on the ear of
the traveller.</p>

<p>And there are many other bird-voices that delight
any one who takes pleasure in sound. When silvery
moonbeams streamed over the camp, the night-jars
(especially <i>Caprimulgus fossei</i> [Verr.] Hartl.) buzzed and
hummed forth their strange song everywhere around. No
matter how remote and desolate the wilderness in which
the traveller laid down his head to rest, these goat-suckers
were to be heard. Their voice makes a strong impression
on us even in our own country in the lonely woods, but
its effect is much more striking, on the far-off equatorial
velt. With noiseless soft beating of its wings the bird
comes gliding past us; its wings almost touch us. When
it pours forth its song, its monotonous sleepy song, I
could listen to it for hours. In the daytime it starts up
suddenly from the ground here and there in front of
you, uttering the feeblest of cries, that it is impossible
to represent. In the next instant it vanishes like some
huge moth, and even the sharpest eye cannot distinguish
it amongst the dry branches and leaves, or
clinging close to the rocky ground. The song of the
night-jar is among my most vivid recollections of the
bird-voices of Africa.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of water, wherever it may be,
and in the thick undergrowth, wherever the African
wilderness extends, you hear the call and cry of a peculiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
bird-voice. It rings out through the stillness with a
deep double piping note, that impresses itself in a lasting
way on the ear. It is the voice of the handsome organ-shrike
(<i>Laniarius &aelig;thiopicus</i>, Gm.). These shrikes, which
mate permanently, always utter this note in such quick
succession, one of the pair after the other, that at first
you think you are listening to only a single bird. This
beautiful bird-note indicates the proximity of water, and
thus it has acquired quite a special significance in these
countries.</p>

<p>Finally there is no sound from the throat of a bird
that I call to mind so plainly, or so continually, as the
song of the African nightingale (<i>Erithacus africanus</i>,
[Fschr.] Rchw.). I have very frequently heard this beautiful
song during the months of our winter, in many districts
round Kilimanjaro. When I heard it unexpectedly for
the first time, I was most deeply moved by it. Ten
years ago I heard it during a day’s march in the wooded
gullies of the great volcanic mountain, and it was most
clear and full and beautiful. I never expected thus to
hear this northern bird-voice in the tropics. Later on,
when I was camped at a considerable altitude in the
primeval forests of Kilimanjaro, I was saluted with the
cries of northern migratory birds, that, wheeling round
the mountain, seemed to be flying over its everlasting
snowfields. It was a strange coincidence in those
Christmas days, the song of the northern nightingale,
and those northern birds of passage on the wing under
the equatorial sun! It is worth noting that this voice of
the nightingale was the only genuine northern bird-song
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
that I ever heard in Africa. That our nightingale also
sometimes breeds there is indicated by the discovery of
its nest by the late Dr. Fischer. But the problem of
the extraordinary identity in character of this nightingale
with its northern sister still awaits solution. Many
difficult observations will have to be made in order to
investigate it thoroughly.</p>

<p>What a contrast to this song of our northern
nightingale is presented by the voices of the hyenas
and jackals, the strange cry uttered by the leopard, all
the sounds emitted by the antelopes, and finally the
indescribably startling, harsh-sounding bellow of the
crocodile!</p>

<p>But neither individually nor collectively can the effect
of all these voices be expressed in words. They associate
themselves with the forms of a flora untouched by the
hand of man, and the unceasing throb of animal life. I
think of them all together as a theatre of nature now
flooded with sunlight, now in the mysterious darkness of
night, or with glistening moonbeams playing over it.
What impresses one so much is not merely these individual
voices, but the way in which all the myriad voices
mingle in one mighty chorus.</p>

<p>If this symphony of nature is to be written down, it
must be by some master who will combine in one
marvellous melody these musical utterances that are so
mighty and impressive, so full of mystery and charm,
and so often dying away in the deepest and most delicate
cadences. None of these tones should be missing, no
note of them all should be struck out.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>I should like to set in contrast with this mighty
primeval harmony of the wilderness the sounds and
voices of the modern industrial world, which gradually
and unwittingly we take to be something natural. He
who would feel all its greatness and perfection must keep
himself far away for weeks and months from the screaming
whistle he hears on the railway, and the howling siren of
a steamship.</p>

<p>Then there is the insect world! Those flower-covered
bushes have attracted a multitude of great droning beetles.
They hasten to them in heavy flight. On the ground
a host of scarab&aelig;us beetles are busy with their special
work. The ceaseless sharp chirps of the cicadas sing
their continual song. Through all its variations there
goes on this hum and buzz of the millions and millions
of the lower creation. And joined with it there ring
out the thousands and thousands of songs of the birds;
the powerful voices of the great mammals bellow over
plain and bushland, through swamps and primeval forests,
over dale and hill. The concert of the feathered songsters
is suddenly silent, as, it may be, the harsh cry of the
leopard resounds, or the mighty, dull, rumbling roar of
the king of the desert thunders over the earth; or the
trumpet-like cry of the elephant vibrates through the
woods; or harsh war-cries from human lips, battle-songs
of primitive men, are heard&mdash;but heedless of it all, even
at these moments, day and night resound the weak voices
of all the myriads of lesser creatures of the animal world.
But he who penetrates into this wilderness must have
receptive senses to understand the full beauty of it all.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
For him this harmony exists wherever the primitive
animal world lives its life.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="hang"><small>ON THE WEST SIDE OF KILIMANJARO I FOUND A BROOK, CALLED BY THE

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p></div>

<p>Glorious and grand, too, is the language of Nature
when she herself raises her primeval voice, associated
with no sound of life that we can perceive. Thus it
is in the hours of storm by night, when on the plain,
or in the primeval forest, or on the hill slopes, the thunder
roars round the little camp, and the crackling lightning
comes down in zig-zags. Then the rumbling thunder,
the rushing downpour of the water-floods, the roar of
the storm-wind, speak with an impressiveness that is
beyond all description. Then in their hour of death the
giants of the primeval forest, the mighty, venerable
trees, suddenly themselves find a voice that strikes
loudly on the ear: they groan in the embrace of the
wind, and under its fury crash thundering to the ground.
Then, when the earth and the rocks under our feet seem
to shake, when the powers of Nature are let loose in all
their might, when weak little man in his small tent,
alone in the midst of all this violence, listens to the sounds,
alone and abandoned like the sailor on a frail plank in
the midst of a raging ocean, then it is that the wilderness
sings its greatest, noblest, most wonderful song.</p>

<p>The traveller may yet return to the African wilderness
and hear once more the voices of the smaller denizens
of the wild. The chirping of cicadas will lull him to
rest, or the buzzing of the mosquitoes forbid it. Their
chirping and buzzing will bear witness that these waves
of life roll on untroubled and uninjured by the incoming
of civilisation. But the greater voices will become rarer and
rarer. Soon the trumpeting of the elephant, the roar of the
lion, the bellow of the hippopotamus will be heard no longer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>But to-day one can still hear all these sounds which
I have described, and which our most remote ancestors
listened to all day and all night in the ages when there
still lived in Europe a fauna very similar to that which
we find dying out in East Africa. By day and night
they go forth in trees and thickets, by swamp and
reed-bed. The song of birds is accompanied by the
monotonous deafening chorus of the bullfrogs. Even
in the traveller’s tent the crickets chirp, and the night-jar
buzzes and buzzes past it, and tells and whispers of
the nightly life and movement of the animal world, in
its monotonous mysterious song.</p>

<p>A jackal holds a conversation with the evening star.
In the dark night the deep bass of the hyena is heard;
and then it laughs aloud, in a weird, shrill, shrieking
treble. This laugh, seldom uttered, but when heard
making one’s heart shudder, is not a thing to forget; on
feverish nights it plagues one still in memory. No one
need jest about it who has not himself heard it. He
who has heard it understands how the Arabs take the
hyenas to be wicked men living under a spell.</p>

<p>Now at last the lion raises his commanding voice, and
one thing only is wanting to the whole nocturnal spell&mdash;the
noisy trampling of timid and harassed droves of
zebras and other herds of wild things. But if the ground
of the velt, hardened by the burning sun, rings once
more to the thundering hoof-beats of the zebras, the
eye fails in the darkness, and only our ears perceive by
their numberless sounds the waves of life that are surging
around us; and then indeed the listener comes to full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
consciousness of how rich the animal-language of the
Ny&iacute;ka still is.... Nowhere else in the world of
to-day do all the voices of the wild resound more
impressively, and for him who listens to this language
there is no escape from that mysterious spell&mdash;the Spell of
the Elelescho!</p>

While this book is passing through the press several correspondents
have sent me an article published by Freiherr von Schr&ouml;tter-Wohnsdorf in
the <i>Monatsheften des Allgemeinen Deutschen Jagdschutsvereins</i> of August 24th,
1906. According to this article, during the year 1906, by ministerial orders,
in four of the chief forest districts of East Prussia, <i>sixty-seven head of wild
elk</i> were killed off, though hitherto the few remaining living specimens
of the elk have been so carefully preserved both on public and private
estates. This thorough-going course was adopted for the sake of the
preservation of the woods from damage by the animals. That this should
have been done in the case of a disappearing species of wild animal,
hitherto so carefully preserved, and of which private individuals were
allowed to shoot only male specimens, is in open contradiction with those
views as to the necessity of protecting the rarer beauties of nature, which
are making such progress every day. It seems therefore fitting that I
should note the fact here as showing how well grounded is my opinion that
the progress of civilised culture is destructive to those treasures of nature
that have come down to us from primeval times.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">17</a>
The author believes that he cannot better give expression to his
views as to the preservation of the beauties of nature, than by reproducing
an article on the appearance of the stork in the Soldin district, by Herr
M. Kurth. He writes in <i>Die Jagd, Illustrierte Wochenschrift f&uuml;r deutsche
J&auml;ger</i>, May 13, 1906:
</p>
<p>
“As for the stork-shooting appointed by the District Committee of the
districts of Soldin, Landsberg and Ost-Sternberg for the period from
March 1 to June 15, it is to be remarked that the opinions held by
sportsmen as to the damage done by storks, especially in reference to
small game, are very much divided, and that not much can be put to the
reckoning of ‘Brother Longlegs’ of those misdeeds that figure heavily in
the accounts of other robbers, such as the crane, the magpie, and all kinds
of native birds of prey, and the hedgehog, marten, and polecat. These
one and all carry off nestlings, and most of them attack young leverets also.
Now if we are to go for the stork, it should of course be done when
he is to be found together in too great numbers; and this is entirely the
idea of the District Committee. The neighbourhood of Balz bei Vietz
on the Eastern Railway has always been remarkable for the number of its
storks’ nests. One finds two of them on nearly every one of the old barns,
a nest at each end of the roof. It was so even thirty years ago, and so it
is to this day. But the proprietors of the barns never agree to the nests
of the storks being destroyed, or any opposition made to the settling there
of these trustful and friendly birds. And for what reasons precisely has
‘Friend Adebar’ settled in such numbers in this district? Well, here the
far-spreading meadows of the Warthe, with their full scope for extended
flight, offer him all the food he wants and to spare, and here the frogs’
legs must be particularly good. It may be that now and again a young
partridge or a leveret strays into Mother Stork’s kitchen, but that is
the exception. Now if people keep strictly to the object indicated by the
District Committee, namely to bring down the numbers of the storks where
there are too many of them, one may let it pass. But how many will out
of a mere shooting-mania take aim continually at the harmless birds!&mdash;though
such are never genuine sportsmen. How can this be checked?
And it should not be forgotten that in the first week of April our African
guests are to be found in hundreds along the Warthe brook, whence they
then disperse to various parts of the neighbouring districts. Now it is to
be hoped that no one will assume that the stork is to be found here
‘in too great numbers,’ and that therefore ‘one may blaze away at him.’
In some years this may possibly be the case, but if he were scared
out of the district our landscape would be the poorer by the loss of the
bird’s welcome cry, as has happened in the case of the heron and
the cormorant in our district. This last-named bird comes now only
seldom, and then only one at a time, to the Netze, near Driesen. There
was a heronry formerly near Waldowstrenk in the Neumark district,
but it disappeared ten years ago. We must hope that this will not be
the fate of the stork, whose appearance has so many links with the poetry
of our childhood, and that we shall not be deprived of his presence.
What a pleasing sight it is when ‘Brother Longlegs’ with dignified walk
stalks beside the mower at haymaking time, looking so confiding and
fearless! And what a joy it is to old and young when the first stork of
the season wheels in circles over the homestead, when for the first time he
comes down to his old nest, and announces his arrival with a joyful outcry!
Must not every sympathetic and thoughtful lover of nature be filled with
sorrow and indignation when, on the pretext of petty thefts, but probably
out of mere wanton love of destruction, attempts are made to drive out of
our country this friendly bird, which is so pleasing an ornament of the
landscape? It would really be a crime against the out-door beauty of our
native land, and against nature all around us, if out of narrow-minded
selfishness we were to extirpate the stork, as happened in recent times
to that most splendidly coloured of our birds, the kingfisher, on mere
suspicion of its being a ‘great destroyer’ of fish. Love of nature, joy in
nature, is a valuable element in German feeling, and therefore, dear fellow
sportsman, let us maintain our good character!”</p></div>

We are indebted to the English hunters of those days for all the
information we possess as to the wild life of South Africa at that time. If
there had not been amongst them men who knew also how to handle the
pen, we should have been almost entirely without trustworthy information
as to that period. I may take this opportunity of saying a word for the
English “record-making sportsman,” who is not unfrequently the subject of
false and unfounded invectives, which I can only describe as mostly full
of fanciful fables. Other lands, other ways, and there are black sheep in
every nation. In any case we may take English ideals of sport as our
example, and also the regulations drawn up by English authorities for the
protection of the animal world.</p></div>

number of shots fired in a year at game at 16,000,000, besides some
6,000,000 shots fired at animals that are not game. He rightly notes that
for the individual the whole business of sport is a losing or non-productive
occupation, but one of productive value for the households of the country
folk, as about 130,000,000 marks are annually spent upon it.</p></div>

the purpose of making a collection of their fauna for the Copenhagen

The destruction of wild animals by the Boers in the Kilimanjaro
district was in every way opposed by the central and local authorities,
but failing the possibility of strict control it does not seem to have
been possible to make the regulations effective. Prof. Sj&ouml;stedt found the
Boers in no way settled down, but roving about the country in pursuit
of the wild animals.</p></div>

So too, for example, Wissmann never killed a lion. This is sufficient
proof of the difficulty of observing animal life. The author may take this
opportunity of calling attention to the remarkable work of this departed
explorer, <i>In den Wildnissen Afrikas</i>, and thinks himself fortunate in the
possession of a letter from his hand approving of his method of observing
animals. This letter expresses in words that go to the heart

characterised this successful and distinguished explorer.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
